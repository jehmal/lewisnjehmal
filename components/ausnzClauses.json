      "fullText": "This Standard may be applied through legislative requirements, made in each state and territory of Australia and in New Zealand, concerned with the safety of electrical installations. The Standard may also be applied in conjunction with any additional requirements, exemptions, or restrictions in such legislation.\nThe principal application of this Standard is to electrical installations in all types of premises and land used by electricity consumers. However, the Standard may also be referenced or applied through legislative or other requirements relating to the effect of electrical installations in matters such as the following:\n• (a) Safety of workplaces.\n  o NOTE: For example, any relevant work health and safety legislation and associated codes.\n• (b) Safe design and construction of buildings.\n  o NOTE: For example, national building codes [such as the National Construction Code (NCC), New Zealand Building Code (NZBC)] and the associated referenced Standards. See Appendix E for information on NCC and NZBC.\n• (c) Electricity generation, transmission, and distribution systems.\n• (d) Safe connection to electricity distribution systems.\n  o NOTE: For example, service rules and conditions provided by local electricity distributors.\n• (e) Qualifications of electricity workers.\nPart 1 (Section 1) of this Standard provides a mechanism for acceptance of design and installation practices that may not be addressed by those given in Part 2 (Sections 2 to 8) of this Standard. This mechanism is only intended to apply where departures from the methods in Part 2 are significant.\n• NOTE: A degree of flexibility exists within Part 2.",

For service fuses refer Note 5.\n\nNOTES:\n1. A coordination study requires the calculation of the prospective short-circuit currents, and comparison of the operating time of various protective devices, taking into consideration the actual current seen by each protective device. Manufacturer’s data should be used to assess coordination (discrimination and back up) in the short-circuit area (above the short delay or Instantaneous setting of the protective devices).\n2. Detailed requirements for coordination (selectivity and back up) as well as symbols, figures and examples are given in relevant Standards as follows: MCCBs and ACBs—AS/NZS IEC 60947.2, MCBs—AS/NZS 60898.\n3. If devices are to be installed above their rated short-circuit capacity, the backup protection (cascading) requirements for circuit-breaker or fuse selection needs to be determined from manufacturer’s data. Discrimination (selectivity), when backup protection of a circuit-breaker is applied, is limited (partial) and the value needs to be obtained from the manufacturer.\n4. Refer to Clause 2.5.5 for other requirements for ≥800 A main switchboards.\n5. The electricity distributor should be consulted for discrimination requirements between installation protective devices and the electricity distributor’s service protective devices. The curves and settings of service protective devices will be required. For example, a 100 A service fuse will discriminate with a 32 A MCB.\n6. Discrimination requirements are not retrospective.\n7.

The types of cable insulation given in Table 3.2 are included in relevant specifications, i.e. the AS/NZS 5000 series, AS/NZS 3191, AS/NZS 3808 and AS/NZS 60702.1.\n2. Lower maximum temperatures will apply where materials used in the construction of the cables or in association therewith, such as coverings, sheathings, insulating sleeving on connections and sealing compounds, have maximum operating temperatures lower than the cable proper. However, the allowable operating temperatures for such materials shall not be exceeded.\n3. If manufacturer’s recommendations permit, cables may be installed in locations where temperatures lower than specified may occur.\n4. The normal operating temperature of thermoplastic cables, including flexible cords installed as installation wiring, is based on a conductor temperature of 75°C. This is because of the risk of thermal deformation of insulation if the cables are clipped, fixed or otherwise installed in a manner that exposes cable to severe mechanical pressure at higher temperatures.\nV-90 and V-90HT insulated cables may be operated up to the maximum permissible temperatures of 90°C and 105°C, provided that the cable is installed in a manner that is not subject to, or is protected against, severe mechanical damage for temperatures higher than 75°C. Such applications also allow for cables to be installed in:\n(a) locations where the ambient temperature exceeds 40°C, e.g. equipment wiring in luminaires and heating appliances, or in roof spaces affected by high summer temperatures; and\n(b) locations affected by bulk thermal insulation that restricts the dissipation of heat from the cable."

A harmonic current load that constitutes not less than 40% of the total load on any single phase is regarded as substantial.\n  2. The third harmonic currents (and odd multiples thereof) are additive to the normal 50 Hz current to be carried.

Stand-alone systems may be supplied with power from one or more of the following: (i) Photovoltaic array. (ii) Wind turbine or mini-hydro turbine. (iii) Engine-driven generator set in the form of an a.c. supply or a d.c. supply. (c) Inverter system: An inverter system that provides an a.c. power supply from an interactive inverter using a renewable energy source, such as photovoltaic, wind turbine, or mini-hydro turbine. In the event of the renewable energy output available exceeding the electrical installation load, subject to formal approval of the electricity distributor, any surplus energy available is exported into the distribution system. If the output available from the renewable energy sources is insufficient for the installation loading, the shortfall in energy required is imported from the network. The interactive inverter of the system also provides control of the exporting and importing of energy from the system and network.
