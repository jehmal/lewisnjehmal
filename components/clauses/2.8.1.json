  "fullText": "Suitable protective measures shall be taken whereâ€”\n(a) the loss and subsequent restoration of voltage; or\n(b) a drop in voltage,\ncould cause danger to persons or property.\n\nException: Where potential damage to electrical equipment is considered an acceptable risk, undervoltage protection may be omitted.\n\nNOTES:\n1. Examples where the loss and subsequent restoration of voltage might cause danger include unexpected restarting of equipment, such as a guillotine, press or electrically operated gates. See also Clause 4.13 regarding protection of motors.\n2. Failure to provide sufficient voltage will significantly reduce motor torque and will result either in an excessively long starting time or, for extreme cases, in failure to start.\n\nThe requirements of Clause 2.8.2 shall apply where an electrical installation is protected against undervoltage that may cause danger to persons or property.\n\nNOTE: The causes of undervoltage in an electrical installation may include the following:\n(a) Overload, or conductors of inadequate cross-section, producing excessive voltage drop.\n(b) A fault in the high voltage supply system.\n(c) Failure of, or high impedance in, a supply conductor."
