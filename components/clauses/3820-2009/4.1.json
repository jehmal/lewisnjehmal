Such means of identification may includeâ€”\n(i) Business name and business address (other than a post office box number) in each country of sale (Australia and/or New Zealand);\n(ii) Registered business name (Australia and/or New Zealand);\n(iii) Australian Company Number (ACN), for products sold only in Australia;\n(iv) Australian Business Number (ABN), for products sold only in Australia;\n(v) New Zealand Company Number, for products sold only in New Zealand;\n(vi) Trademark registered in each country of sale (Australia and/or New Zealand); and\n(vii) Supplier code number issued by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Australia), Radio Spectrum Management (New Zealand) or the Regulatory Compliance Mark (RCM) registrar.\n\n(c) The electrical equipment, together with its component parts, shall be made in such a way as to ensure that it can be safely and properly assembled, installed and connected.\n\n(d) The electrical equipment shall be so designed and manufactured as to ensure that protection against the dangers set out in Clauses 4.2 and 4.3 is assured, providing the equipment is used in applications for which it was made and is adequately maintained.\n\nNOTE The expression 'used in applications for which it was made' would be considered to include foreseeable environmental conditions and foreseeable misuse. Also, where electrical equipment is for location in restricted access areas (i.e. not generally accessible to the public), it may be assumed that the equipment is only accessible to service personnel."
