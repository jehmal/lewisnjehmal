    "title": "PROTECTION AGAINST HAZARDS CAUSED BY EXTERNAL INFLUENCES ON ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT",
    "fullText": "Electrical equipment shall comply with the following criteria:\n\n(a) The electrical equipment shall meet the expected mechanical requirements in such a way that persons, domestic animals and property are not endangered.\n\nNOTE For example, the design of tools and similar equipment, which may be used outdoors, should take account of more adverse conditions of use than would apply to indoor devices. If the equipment is not for fixed or hand-held use, it should be sufficiently stable to remain in a specific position.\n\n(b) The electrical equipment shall be resistant to non-mechanical influences in environmental conditions in such a way that persons, domestic animals and property are not endangered.\n\nNOTE For example, electrical equipment likely to be used near water should have the appropriate degree of protection against entry of water.\n\n(c) The electrical equipment shall not endanger persons, domestic animals or property in conditions of overload."
