For further guidance, refer to Appendix M.\nCircuits for safety services shall be separate from those used to supply the remainder of the electrical installation, as required by Clause 7.2.2.\nNOTES:\n1\tThe most common distribution arrangement for a low voltage electrical installation is radial branched distribution, an example of which is shown in Figure B1 (Appendix B).\n2\tDivision of circuits falls logically into several categories, each an individual circuit or group of circuits. Typically, the circuit groups selected are as follows:\n(a)\tLighting.\n(b)\tSocket-outlets.\n(c)\tHeating and/or airconditioning appliances.\n(d)\tMotor-driven plant.\n(e)\tAuxiliary services, such as indication and control.\n(f)\tSafety services.\n3\tAppendix C\tprovides\tguidance\ton\tcircuit\tarrangements\tfor\tbasic applications."
