    "Appendix B illustrates a method of complying with the requirements of this Clause based on the determination of the maximum length of a circuit in relation to the size of circuit conductors and type of protective device.",
    "Guidance on the measurement of the earth fault-loop impedance of each circuit is given in Appendix B.",
    "Table B.1 contains calculated examples of the maximum values of earth fault-loop impedance, 𝑍𝑠, using approximate mean tripping currents for a limited range of miniature circuit-breakers (MCBs) (taken from AS/NZS 60898 and manufacturers' time/current characteristic curves) and fuses (taken from IEC 60269 series) and the appropriate disconnection time."
