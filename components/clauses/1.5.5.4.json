  "title": "Protection by the use of Class II equipment or by equivalent insulation",
  "fullText": "The following applies:\n• (a) Protection against the occurrence of dangerous voltages on accessible conductive parts of electrical equipment in the event of a fault in the basic insulation may be achieved by one of the following means:\no (i) Equipment having double or reinforced insulation (Class II equipment).\no (ii) Switchgear assemblies having total insulation in accordance with AS/NZS 61439.1.\no (iii) Equipment having basic insulation with appropriate supplementary insulation applied during installation.\no (iv) Equipment having uninsulated live parts with appropriate reinforced insulation applied during installation.\nWhere the means of Item (iii) or (iv) is used, the additional insulation and the intended use of the electrical equipment shall provide a degree of safety equivalent to Items (i) or (ii).\nNOTES:\n1. Coatings, such as paint, varnish, enamel, or similar products, are not considered appropriate insulating covering for the purpose of this Clause.\n2. In accordance with Clause 1.5.14, where damage to double insulation may be reasonably expected, precautions should be taken to ensure protection. Such precautions may include earthing the enclosure or RCD protection.\n• (b) Constructional requirements: Where protection is dependent on a separate covering or enclosure providing supplementary insulation, the following shall apply:\no (i) Any insulating covering shall not contain any screws or bolts made of insulating material if there is a risk of impairment of the insulation by the replacement of such screws or bolts with metal screws or bolts.\no (ii) Where lids or doors in any insulating enclosure can be opened without the use of a tool or key, conductive parts shall be located behind an insulating barrier that provides a degree of protection not less than IPXXB or IP2X and shall not be removable only by use of a tool."
