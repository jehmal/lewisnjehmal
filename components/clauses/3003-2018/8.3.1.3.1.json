    "title": "Colour coding",
    "fullText": "All socket-outlets in the cardiac-protected electrical area shall be inspected to ensure correct colour coding. Socket-outlet colour coding requirements are specified in Clause 2.7.4.3.\nColour coding applies to socket-outlets that accept 10 A, 15 A or 20 A plugs conforming to AS/NZS 3112. These are the common Australian/New Zealand socket-outlets that accept plugs with flat active and neutral pins.\nColour coding shall apply at a minimum to the socket and the associated switch mechanism.\nNOTE: This Standard did not mandate colour coding prior to the 2003 edition, but under AS/NZS 2500 the health care facility (responsible organization) has a duty of care to change the colour of the socket-outlets to indicate the source of electrical supply."
