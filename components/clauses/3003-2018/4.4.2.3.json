    "fullText": "An EP earthing system shall only be provided with one EP junction.\nAll points associated with a cardiac-protected electrical area that are required to be connected to the EP earthing system shall be earthed via the EP junction or one of its nodes in accordance with Clauses 4.4.2.4 to 4.4.2.7.\nThe EP earthing system may have a number of separate nodes at strategic locations connected to the EP junction, as shown in Figure 8, provided that the following requirements are met:\n(a)\tEach node is individually connected to the EP junction by insulated conductors with a maximum resistance of 0.01 Ω.\n(b)\tEach node is accessible and its location identified by labelling.\n(c)\tEach node is fully insulated or isolated from contact with structural metal.\n(d)\tEach node is numbered and identifies the location of the EP junction.\n(e)\tEach conductor installed between a node and the EP junction is numbered at the EP junction to identify the node.\n(f)\tThe EP junction identifies the number of nodes connected.\nNOTES:\n1\tThe arrangement referred to above may be used to limit the length of individual EP earth conductors in large cardiac-protected electrical areas with many patient locations.\n2\tTo measure the resistance, disconnecting one end of the conductor installed between the EP junction and each node and measuring its resistance using a four-terminal milliohm measuring device.\n3\tThe earthing conductor of a multi-core supply cable from a switchboard to an imaging system may be used as a return earth providing that the EP junction is connected to the main earthing terminal/bus of the imaging system with a conductor having a maximum resistance of 0.01 Ω (see Figure 9)."
