    "fullText": "Residual current devices that are used as LPDs shall not protectâ€”\n(a)\tmore than 12 electrical points, i.e. socket-outlets, items of permanently-wired equipment or combinations thereof; or\nNOTE: For the purpose of this Clause, a double socket-outlet is considered to be two points.\n(b)\tsocket-outlets in different rooms.\nExceptions:\n1\tSocket-outlets mounted in the ceiling space of a patient area in accordance with Clause 2.4.3.2.\n2\tThe supply to socket-outlets in more than one patient location in body-protected electrical areas.\n3\tSocket-outlets identified 'CLEANING PURPOSES ONLY'.\nNOTES:\n1\tAttention is drawn to the desirability in certain areas of fewer points being controlled by any one RCD.\n2\tIn planning the number of points controlled by one RCD, consideration should be given to minimizing interruption of supply to any patient location because of excessive leakage current, given that a Type I RCD may trip at residual currents as low as 4.5 mA.\n3\tRefer to Clause 4.3, which disallows an RCD used as an LPD from protecting socket-outlets in more than one patient location of a cardiac-protected electrical area (except socket-outlets identified 'CLEANING PURPOSES ONLY').\n4\tThe number of socket-outlets and permanently connected equipment protected by each RCD should be recorded in the commissioning report."
