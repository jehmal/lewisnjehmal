    "fullText": "Each low-voltage transformer-isolated supply that is connected to any socket-outlet shall be provided with an overload monitor in accordance with AS/NZS 4510 to monitor the load current.\nThe alarm current setting of the overload monitor shall be identified on the monitor in accordance with Clause 2.12.1 to facilitate testing.\nFor routine testing and commissioning, the alarm setting overloads shall be verified by applying the following process to each transformer isolated supply.\n(a)\tThe rating of the isolation transformer and the supply circuit breaker shall be verified by inspection and recorded in the commissioning report.\n(b)\tA slowly rising load current is applied to the transformer-isolated supply. The overload alarm shall activate at between 95â€“100% of the rated set alarm load current. This current shall be less than the supplying circuit breaker. The load current at which the alarm activates shall be recorded in the commissioning report.\nNOTES:\n1\tAS/NZS 4510 requires the overload alarm system to actuate at a time between 3 s and 5 s after the current of the isolating transformer has exceeded its rated value.\n2\tThe overload monitor may be combined with the line isolation monitor required by Clause 2.9.5."
