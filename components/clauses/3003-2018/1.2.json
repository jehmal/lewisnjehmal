    "fullText": "Electrical installations in patient areas shall be carried out in accordance with AS/NZS 3000, except as varied herein, and with the additional requirements of this Standard.\nThe decisions made by the responsible organization/entity in determining classification of patient areas need to be based on the medical procedures undertaken in each area. Advice on whether particular patient areas should be wired as body-protected or cardiac-protected electrical areas is specified in AS/NZS 2500. The responsible organization/entity should refer to the safe practice code in AS/NZS 2500 for advice on how these decisions should be based on the type of procedures undertaken in each area and the level of protection against electric shock afforded in the medical electrical equipment available for these procedures.\nWhile this Standard is intended to apply to new installations or extensions, some guidance is given concerning conversion of older installations.\nAreas other than patient areas are not covered by this Standard, but are covered by the relevant requirements of AS/NZS 3000.\nRequirements for mobile trolleys supporting electrical equipment are given in AS/NZS 3551.\nRequirements for emergency lighting are given in AS/NZS 2293.1.\nRequirements for emergency power systems in hospitals are given in AS/NZS 3009.\nIn New Zealand, mobile medical connectable installations shall be in accordance with the requirements of this Standard and NZS 6115.\nThis Standard nominates specific maximum values of electromagnetic interference. This matter needs careful consideration at the design stage. In some patient areas, these values need to be measured.\nNOTE: See Section 6 for alterations to equipotential earthing in existing installations."
