    "title": "Equipotential earthing of non-electrical equipment and fittings",
    "fullText": "This Standard does not require equipotential earthing of non-electrical fittings unless they are accessible in the patient environment.\nPermanently installed non-electrical, conductive equipment and fittings that are accessible in the patient environment and that contact structural metal shall be connected to the EP junction or node via permanently installed equipotential earthing conductors as follows:\n(a)\tWhere accessible fittings such as medical gas outlets and water taps contact reticulated metal services such as medical gas, water or drainpipes, the reticulated metal services shall be connected to the EP junction.\n(b)\tWhere accessible fittings such as hinged window frames or lift-out air-conditioning registers contact structural metal via a fixed metal assembly, the fixed metal assembly or underlying metal wall frame shall be connected to the EP junction or node.\n(c)\tWhere one or more fittings, such as towel rails, monitor brackets, equipment rails or soap/towel/glove dispensers, contact structural metal via a metal wall frame, the metal wall frame shall be connected to the EP junction or node.\nEquipotential earthing conductors used to connect non-electrical equipment and fittings to the EP junction or node shall be insulated and segregated from contacting other conductive items except at the EP junction.\nEach point identified in Items (a) to (c) above shall be connected to the EP junction or node via an individual earthing conductor having a resistance not exceeding 0.1 Ω.\nFor the purpose of this Clause, non-electrical fittings are regarded as contacting structural metal if the resistance to the EP junction or node is less than 1 MΩ when measured at 500 V d.c."
