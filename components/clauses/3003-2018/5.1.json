    "fullText": "The patient areas specified in this Section shall be in accordance with Sections 2 and 3, as varied by this Section.\nThis Section applies to all areas where medical electrical equipment, including dialysis machines and their associated water treatment plants, are used.\nNOTE: Medical equipment that is provided to a patient for use in the home, by the responsible organization, presents challenges, particularly in terms of ready access to undertake performance verification activities. Nonetheless, the medical electrical equipment should, as far as practical, undergo performance verification in the same manner as medical equipment that is part of the normal inventory of the system.\nMedical equipment utilized in the home is exposed to adverse treatment (from children, pets, etc.) often in excess of that within a clinical setting. It is operated in an environment that may be quite variable in many respects, and is used by individuals that may not be trained health care professionals and that may not have ready and immediate access to technical support or advice.\nTo accommodate this, appropriate protocols and procedures, taking into account local circumstances, available access to the loan medical equipment, etc., to ensure that the integrity and safety of the medical equipment is not compromised, should be made available by the responsible organization or service entity."
