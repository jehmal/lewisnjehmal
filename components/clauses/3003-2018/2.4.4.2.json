    "fullText": "Low-voltage a.c. circuits that originate from a UPS and that are required to be LPD protected shall be installed as follows:\n(a)\tWhere the output circuit of the UPS is not earth referenced in every mode of operation, the UPS shall be treated as an isolation transformer and provided with a LIM and (where required) an overload monitor as required in Clause 2.9 (see Figure 5). The output circuit of the UPS shall be isolated from earth to the extent necessary to ensure that the maximum prospective hazard current is less than 2 mA when connected to the circuit wiring and the LIM.\nNOTE: The output of such a UPS is known as a 'separated circuit' in AS/NZS 3000.\n(b)\tWhere one output terminal of the UPS is connected to the neutral input terminal earthed within the UPS, the output shall be protected by one or more RCDs as specified in Clause 2.8, or by one or more isolation transformers provided with LIMs and (where required) overload monitors as required in Clause 2.9 (see Figures 6 and 7).\nNOTES:\n1\tThe output of such a UPS is considered a supply with an earthed neutral.\n2\tThis configuration will result in loss of supply whenever the residual current device (RCD) trips."
