In selecting the location, attention should be given to the following:\n(a)\tThe need for access to the EP earthing system during commissioning and in-service testing, alterations and additions.\n(b)\tPhysical and electrical considerations that might favour the location of the EP junction at or near one of the non-LPD protected points.\n(c)\tThe relative locations of associated RCDs or isolation transformers."
