    "fullText": "Where permanently wired electrical equipment is supplied from an LPD-protected circuit that also supplies socket-outlets or other permanently wired electrical equipment, the electrical equipment shall be provided with a separate, individual, readily accessible isolation switch that opens all live supply conductors. For the purpose of this requirement, electrical equipment that is powered from a socket-outlet that is not readily accessible in the patient area shall be treated as permanently wired electrical equipment.\nIsolation switches shall be clearly identified in accordance with Clause 2.12.1 to identify the electrical equipment they isolate. The style of identification shall be 'FROM RCD X OR LIM X-ISOLATION SWITCHâ€”DENTAL CHAIR'.\nExceptions:\n1\tThe isolation switch need not satisfy the requirement for two deliberate actions to operate as described in AS/NZS 3000.\n2\tElectrical equipment does not include monitoring or alarm systems associated with the LPD.\nNOTES:\n1\tFor RCD-protected supplies, 'live' conductors include all active and neutral supply conductors.\n2\tFor transformer-isolated supplies, active conductors include all isolated supply conductors.\n3\tExamples of permanently wired monitoring and alarm systems to which this requirement does not apply because they are associated with the LPD include the LIMs and overload monitors that are a requirement of this Standard, and power-failure alarms that, while not a requirement except for UPS, are commonly associated with RCD-protected circuits.\n4\tClause 2.7.2 requires some socket-outlets to be provided with readily accessible isolating switches."
