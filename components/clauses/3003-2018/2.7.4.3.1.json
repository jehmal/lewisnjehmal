    "fullText": "Socket-outlets that are protected by LPDs and that accept 10 A, 15 A or 20 A plugs conforming to AS/NZS 3112 shall be colour-coded as follows:\n(a)\tSocket-outlets connected to a normal supply shall be colour-coded white.\n(b)\tSocket-outlets connected to an essential supply shall be colour-coded red.\nNOTE: Attention is drawn to the definition of essential supply which excludes supplies that are subject to load shedding (see Clause 1.5.28).\n(c)\tSocket-outlets connected to an uninterruptible supply shall be colour-coded dark blue.\n(d)\tSocket-outlets identified 'CLEANING PURPOSES ONLY' shall be colour-coded beige.\nIf the essential supply is also connected to the UPS, the requirement in Item (c) for socket-outlets connected to an uninterruptible supply takes precedence over the requirement in Item (b).\nThe colour coding shall apply at a minimum to the socket and the associated switch mechanism.\nSurrounds, decorative shrouds, cover plates and associated panels coloured red or dark blue shall only be used with socket-outlets of the same colour.\nNOTE: Attention is drawn to requirements of AS/NZS 3009 that effect the classification of electrical circuits."
