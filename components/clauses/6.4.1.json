  "fullText": "The particular requirements of this Clause (Clause 6.4) apply to electrical installations in locations containing water containers of fountains and water features and their surrounding zones, where the risk of electric shock is increased by a reduction in body resistance and the likelihood of contact of the body with the water and conductive structure(s) in contact with the general mass of earth.\n\nThese requirements are based on the classification of zones surrounding the water container associated with the fountain or water feature and are intended to:\n(a) protect electrical material and electrical equipment from the corrosive effects of chemicals used in the treatment of water in fountains and water features; and\n(b) counter the increased risks of using electrical equipment in areas where the body may be partially immersed in water.\n\nException: These requirements need not apply to fountains or water features where:\n(a) the depth of water does not exceed 0.3 m; or\n(b) suitable means are provided to restrict entry of persons to the water.\n\nCeilings, walls with or without windows, doors, and floors that limit the extent of a room or area containing a fountain or water feature, and fixed partitions that provide effective protection against spraying or splashing water, limit the associated zones.\n\nDue to the nature of these locations, certain methods of protection against electric shock are not permitted. Refer to Clause 6.4.3.2.2.",
