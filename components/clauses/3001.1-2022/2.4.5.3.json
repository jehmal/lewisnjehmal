    "fullText": "The choice of electrical equipment and the means of construction of each service pillar shall be such that all components are provided with a degree of protection of not less than IPX4, in accordance with AS 60529.\nFor socket-outlets, this level of protection shall be provided both when plugs are inserted or removed.\nWhere specific local environmental conditions, such as the presence of nearby fixed sprinklers or a salt or dust laden atmosphere, are present, a minimum of IPX5 or greater degree of protection shall be installed. For example, the location of a service pillar in proximity to fixed water sprinklers would require a minimum degree of protection of IPX5."
