    "fullText": "All underground wiring systems shall be spaced not less than 100 mm from other underground services.\nWiring systems shall maintain a separation from telecommunications, gas and water services in accordance with Table 2.1.\nFurther requirements for the separation of telecommunications, gas and water systems from low voltage wiring systems are provided in AS/NZS 3000.\nTable 2.1 â€” Minimum separation of underground services\nType of service\nMinimum separation of low voltage electrical service identified in accordance with Clause 2.3.2.4 and mechanically protected1\nMinimum separation of conductive enclosures to low voltage electrical earthing electrode1\nmm\nmm\nWater service not greater than DN652\n100\n500\nWater service greater than DN652\n300\n500\nSanitary drainage\n100\n500\nStormwater drainage\n100\n600\nGas\n100\n500\nTelecommunications\n100\n-\nNOTE 1 Authorities, such as water and gas suppliers and electricity distributors, may require their services to be spaced at a greater distance from underground wiring systems.\nNOTE 2 DN = internal diameter of pipe.\nExceptions: These requirements shall not apply to the following:\n1. Two or more underground wiring systems may be grouped together where they are associated with the same electrical installation.\n2. The requirements of this Clause may be varied where a number of services are installed touching in a common trench, provided that each service is installed in a separate enclosure that identifies the service.\n3. Separation distances between conductive enclosures and the earthing electrode are not required where all conductive enclosures are bonded within the installation."
