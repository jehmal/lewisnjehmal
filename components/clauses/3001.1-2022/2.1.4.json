    "fullText": "Where common submains are used, connection of all conductors of the submains at each service pillar shall be such that disconnection of that pillar from the incoming supply conductors does not adversely affect either â€”\n(a) the continuity of supply to any other service pillar; or\n(b) the connection of any other service pillar to the installation's earthing system.\nWhere a service pillar is supplied by an individual branch from a common submain, the length of the branch shall not exceed 3 m.\nTypical arrangements for supply to service pillars using common submains in New Zealand are shown in Figure 2.8."
