    "fullText": "The following requirements apply to overcurrent protection:\n(a) Each socket-outlet mounted on a service pillar shall be individually protected by a separate circuit-breaker that is clearly identified to indicate the socket-outlet that it controls, either by its location in relation to the socket-outlet, or by some form of unambiguous complementary marking.\n(b) The rating of each over-current protective device shall be less than or equal to the rating of the socket-outlet.\nNOTE 1 The consequences of protecting a socket-outlet with an overcurrent protection device of lesser rating in relation to the load should be considered.\nException: A 16 A overload protective device as overcurrent protection for a 15 A three pin, flat-pin fittings (socket-outlets) complying with AS/NZS 3112 for supply to connectable electrical installations is deemed to comply.\nThe interrupting capacity of the overcurrent protection device shall be not less than the prospective short circuit current at the point where the device is installed.\nNOTE 2 Typical service pillar configurations are shown in Figure 2.3 for Australia and Figure 2.6 for New Zealand."
