    "fullText": "Wiring systems installed underground shall be identified by an orange marker tape complying with AS/NZS 2648.1, or orange polymeric cable protection complying with AS 4702. In order to provide early detection of the presence of underground wiring during excavation work, identification shall be positioned at approximately 50 % of the depth of cover above the wiring system or any additional mechanical protection provided for that system.\nWhere the wiring system is chased in rock, orange identification shall be laid directly on top of the wiring system before the concrete is poured.\nException: Identification may be omitted where an underground wiring system is installed by boring, provided that â€”\n(a) the location of the wiring system is marked and recorded in a suitable permanent location that is readily available to any person involved with excavation work at the location of the wiring system; and\n(b) if an enclosure is retained after boring operations, the enclosure is coloured orange."
