    "fullText": "Socket-outlets used to supply connectable electrical installations shall be protected by one or more RCDs with rated residual current not exceeding 30 mA that —\n(a) interrupt all live (active and neutral) conductors; and\n(b) are of a type that provides protection against electric shock that complies with the requirements of a Type A RCD, in accordance with AS/NZS 61008.1 or AS/NZS 61009.1.\nRCDs incorporating Type A functionality along with additional functionality may be installed, including —\n(i) Type F for the protection of circuits carrying high frequency leakage currents, such as those associated with frequency converters and electronic ballasts; or\n(ii) Type B where power inverters or frequency inverters are installed, as specified in the manufacturer's instructions for the specific current-using equipment.\nA combined RCD and overcurrent circuit-breaker (RCBO) complying with AS/NZS 61009.1 may be used to provide the requirements of Clauses 3.3 and 3.4.\nNOTE This does not preclude protection of more than one socket-outlet by a single RCD; however, one RCD should be provided for each socket-outlet to reduce both the possibility and consequences of unwanted tripping."
