  "title": "Exposed Conductive Part",
  "fullText": "A conductive part of electrical equipment that:\n• (a) can be touched with the standard test finger as specified in AS/NZS 3100; and\n• (b) is not a live part but can become live if basic insulation fails.\nExceptions: The term 'exposed conductive part' does not apply to any of the following:\n1. Conductive parts within an enclosure where the parts cannot be touched unless a key or a tool is required to remove the covers of the enclosure.\n2. Conductive parts within electrical equipment where the parts cannot be touched in normal use and during the movement of the electrical equipment, because of its configuration and size.\n3. Conductive parts that are effectively and permanently separated from live parts by double insulation; or other conductive parts that are earthed.\n4. Conductive parts that are in the form of nameplates, screw heads, covers, and similar attachments that cannot become live in the event of failure of insulation of live parts because of the manner in which they are supported and fixed.\n5. A removable or hinged conductive panel fitted to a switchboard or other enclosure containing conductors that are so located and/or restrained that, in the event of any conductor becoming detached from a terminal or mounting, the conductor is incapable of making contact with the panel."
