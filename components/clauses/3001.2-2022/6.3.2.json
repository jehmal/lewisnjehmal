    "fullText": "A visual inspection shall be made when work on an electrical installation has been completed in order to verify that the work complies with the requirements of this Standard.\nThe visual inspection shall be carried out before, or in association with, testing. The visual inspection should, where practicable, be made before the relevant part of the electrical installation is placed in service.\nException: Where the visual inspection of a part of the electrical installation is not practicable at the completion of the work, e.g. not accessible because of enclosure in the building structure, consideration should be given to inspecting that part during the course of the installation.\nThe following items shall be checked, where applicable during the visual inspection, in order to assess that the relevant requirements of this Standard are satisfied. General items include:\n(a) Basic protection (protection against direct contact with live parts), e.g. insulation and enclosure.\n(b) Fault protection (protection against indirect contact with exposed conductive parts), e.g. by the use of automatic disconnection of supply, double insulation or isolating transformers.\n(c) Protection against hazardous parts, e.g. enclosure, guarding or screening of flammable materials, hot surfaces and parts that may cause physical injury.\n(d) Protection against spread of fire, e.g. penetration of fire barriers.\n(e) General condition of the electrical equipment, e.g. signs of damage that could impair safe operation, disconnection of unused electrical equipment.\nSpecific items for visual inspection may be located in AS/NZS 3000."
