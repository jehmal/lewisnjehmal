    "fullText": "An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system may be used to provide an alternative supply for all or part of a low voltage installation in a connectable electrical installation, provided all the following conditions are met:\n(a) The UPS shall comply with AS 62040.1; and\nNOTE 1 AS 62040.1 requires UPS equipment to be designed and tested to prevent back-feeding into the a.c. input connection when the input a.c. supply is absent, and the UPS is producing an a.c. output.\n(b) the UPS shall be installed in accordance with AS/NZS 3000 and the UPS manufacturer's instructions; and\n(c) the circuit(s) supplied by the UPS shall not be able to be supplied by any other source; and\n(d) the circuits supplied by the UPS shall be provided with RCD protection; and\nNOTE 2 The RCD needs to be suitable for the output waveform under earth fault conditions. This may require use of Type B or Type F RCD.\n(e) a transformerless UPS shall not be used to supply fixed wired circuits. Transformerless UPSs may be used only for direct supply to equipment, where the supply input and load output are connected by a detachable connection.\nTypical arrangements for a UPS system are shown in Figure 2.13."
