    "title": "Connections",
    "fullText": "Connections between conductors, and between conductors and other electrical equipment, shall provide electrical continuity, an appropriate level of insulation and adequate mechanical strength.\nThe method of joining or connecting cables shall be suitable for the application and ensure that the conductivity of the joint or connection is not less than that of the conductor.\nAll cables and conductors shall be installed so that there is no undue mechanical stress on any connection.\nThe ends of stranded conductors shall be secured by suitable means, so as to prevent the spreading or escape of individual strands. The ends of stranded conductors shall not be soft-soldered before clamping under a screw or between metal surfaces.\nWhere flexible cords are used as a wiring system in a recreational vehicle, suitable ferrules shall be fitted to each conductor before termination of the conductor. Any flexible cord shall be installed so that undue stress on its connections due to a pull on the cord is alleviated by a pillar, post, grip, tortuous path, or other effective means. Flexible cords shall not be knotted."
