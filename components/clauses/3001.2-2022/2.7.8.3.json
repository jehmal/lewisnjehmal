  "title": "Insulation monitoring first and second fault",
  "fullText": "Where an insulation monitoring device is installed providing automatic disconnection of the supply in case of a first fault, the insulation monitoring device will allow a single fault between a live part and an exposed conductive part to occur without automatic disconnection. A single fault may occur provided that a continuously operating earth fault or insulation monitoring system is fitted and arranged to provide a warning to the operator when an earth fault occurs or insulation value falls below 1.0 MΩ.\nA second fault shall result in automatic disconnection. A prospective touch voltage exceeding 50 V a.c. shall not persist for a time sufficient to cause a risk of harmful physiological effect in a person.\nNOTE Special protective arrangements may need to be made for essential services in insulation monitoring systems.\nThe protective arrangements shall be —\n(a) an overcurrent protective device; and\n(b) an RCD with sensitivity of 30 mA maximum for final subcircuits to locations where there is an increased risk of personnel contact with live conductive parts.\nAccessible conductive parts of the unit, such as the chassis and shielding of communication cabling, shall be connected to the equipotential bonding terminal within the unit.\nIf the insulation resistance between live parts and the unearthed equipotential bonding conductor drops below 50 V (refer to line-to-earth voltage U0 in a fault-free system), the insulation monitoring device shall provide automatic disconnection of the supply."
