    "fullText": "A connectable electrical installation may have multiple sources of supply, either external or internal at low voltage or extra-low voltage.\nParts of the electrical installation within the connectable electrical installation may be supplied either —\n(a) as independent installations, each supplied from only a single source; or\n(b) from multiple sources, provided that each source is at the same voltage and frequency, in accordance with Clause 2.7.7.\nEach supply shall comply with the relevant provisions of this section. In addition to the following requirements:\n(i) External low voltage supplies shall comply with Clauses 2.4 to 2.6.\n(ii) Internal low voltage supplies shall comply with Clause 2.7.2.\n(iii) All extra-low voltage supplies shall comply with Section 5.\n(iv) Interconnections between supplies shall comply with Clause 2.7.7.\n(v) DC systems shall operate at extra-low voltage and comply with Section 5.\nFor the purposes of this Standard, power conversion equipment (PCE), such as inverters and battery chargers are regarded as a delineation point between separate systems operating at different voltage and frequency. See Figures 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12.\nNOTE The input of an inverter is regarded as an extra-low voltage d.c. load and the output is regarded as a low voltage a.c. source.\nEach supply shall be connected to the connectable electrical installation at a switchboard.\nException: This requirement does not apply to extra‑low voltage supplies intended solely for charging of batteries."
