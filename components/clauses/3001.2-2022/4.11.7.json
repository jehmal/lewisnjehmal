    "fullText": "The following structures and items of equipment shall be connected to the earthing point, terminal or bar of the switchboard:\n(a) Any conductive material that forms part of the chassis or frame, regardless of the type of material used for the construction of the exterior of the recreational vehicle or non- recreational vehicle.\n(b) The exterior shell (including attached rigid annexes) if constructed of conductive material. Where the exterior shell comprises a number of conductive sheets, the protective earthing conductor need only be attached directly to one sheet, provided that effective electrical continuity is maintained between all the sheets.\n(c) Accessible conductive materials located within 100 mm of any live parts of the installation. For example, on a vehicle with an exterior shell consisting of non-conductive material, any conductive sheet, such as a stone guard, or other conductive components, that may be externally mounted and located within 100 mm of any part of the electrical installation.\nNOTE Such materials may include door or window frames, internal linings, external cladding or items mounted on the exterior of the vehicle such as stone guards, PV arrays, or antennae.\n(d) The earthing contact of all socket-outlets.\nException: Socketâ€‘outlets supplied by a separation (isolating) transformer.\n(e) The exposed conductive parts of any electrical equipment that is required to be earthed in accordance with AS/NZS 3000.\n(f) The earthing contact of all permanently connected appliances."
