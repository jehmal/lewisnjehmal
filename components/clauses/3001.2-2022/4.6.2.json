    "fullText": "Live parts shall be arranged so that basic protection is provided by the switchboard enclosure.\nBasic protection shall be provided against dangers that may arise from contact with parts of the electrical installation that are live in normal service.\nAcceptable methods to achieve basic protection include:\n(a) Insulation: Live parts shall be completely covered with insulation capable of withstanding the mechanical, chemical, electrical and thermal influences to which they may be subjected in service, and that can only be removed by destruction.\n(b) Enclosures: Live parts shall be inside enclosures that provide a degree of protection of at least IPXXB or IP2X. Enclosures shall be firmly secured in place and have adequate stability and strength to withstand any appreciable distortion caused by the stresses likely to occur in normal operation, including external influences, so that the required degrees of protection and separation from live parts are maintained. The opening of enclosures, or withdrawal of parts of enclosures (e.g. doors, casings, lids, covers and the like) shall not be possible without the use of a key or tool."
