    "fullText": "Low voltage installation wiring conductors shall be clearly identified to indicate their intended function as active, neutral, earthing or equipotential bonding conductors.\nWhere identification is achieved using the colour of the conductor insulation, the colours specified in Table 4.2 shall be used.\nConductors with green, yellow or green/yellow combination coloured insulation or sheathing shall not be used as active or neutral conductors in installation wiring.\nIn New Zealand, use of these colours is restricted for conductors but not for sheathing.\nNOTE The colours recommended for actives are â€”\n(a) red or brown for single-phase; or\n(b) red, white or blue for multiphase.\nWhere colours are used for the identification of cable cores, Australian and New Zealand cable identification colours and European cable identification colours shall not be combined within the same wiring enclosure or the same multi-core cable."
