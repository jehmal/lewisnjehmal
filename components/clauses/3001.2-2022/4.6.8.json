    "fullText": "Wiring associated with switchboards shall be installed in such a manner that, in the event of fire originating at the switchboard, the spread of fire is kept to a minimum.\nWhere a switchboard is enclosed in a case or surrounds, any wiring systems entering the switchboard enclosure shall pass through openings that provide a close fit.\nNOTE 1 There is a very high risk that wiring enclosures, especially those that enter at the top or sides of a switchboard, may contribute to the spread of fire and for this reason wiring systems should be provided with close-fitting entries. In some cases, internal sealing should be provided.\nNOTE 2 An opening with less than 5 mm diameter of free space is considered to be a close fit. Therefore, any opening of 5 mm diameter or greater should be sealed with a fire-retardant sealant.\nNOTE 3 Wiring enclosures, such as conduits, with an internal free space of greater than 5 mm diameter should be sealed to stop any draft effect that may allow the spread of fire."
