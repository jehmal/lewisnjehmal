    "fullText": "Where the supply lead is connected to the connectable electrical installation by means of a detachable connection, the connectable electrical installation shall be fitted with one or more inlet plugs complying with —\n(a) AS/NZS 3112; or\n(b) AS/NZS 3123; or\n(c) IEC 60309-2.\nSee Figure 2.6 for an example of a connectable electrical installation with inlet plug.\nNOTE 1 The choice of the type of inlet plugs should be made following consideration of the conditions of use likely to apply in the area, state or country where it is anticipated that the connectable electrical installation is to be used. This should include the requirements of the relevant regulatory authorities.\nEach inlet plug shall —\n(i) be mounted and fixed in a readily accessible position and in such a manner as to be mechanically protected against any risk of damage that may reasonably be anticipated; and\n(ii) comply with AS 60529 with a minimum degree of protection of IP34, both with and without a cord extension socket inserted; and\n(iii) be provided with a mechanical means of relieving the strain on the supply lead connector.\nNOTE 2 A bracket and insulator, a hook and thimble, or a non-perishable guy rope tensioner are suitable ways of meeting this requirement."
