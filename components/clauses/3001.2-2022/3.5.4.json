    "fullText": "All final subcircuits shall be protected by one or more RCDs with rated residual current not exceeding 30 mA that â€”\n(a) interrupt all live (active and neutral) conductors; and\n(b) are of a type that provides protection against electric shock that complies with the requirements of a Type A RCD in accordance with AS/NZS 61008.1 or AS/NZS 61009.1.\nRCDs incorporating Type A functionality along with additional functionality may be installed, including:\n(i) Type F for the protection of circuits carrying high frequency leakage currents such as those associated with frequency converters and electronic ballasts; or\n(ii) Type B where power inverters or frequency inverters are installed, as specified in the manufacturer's instructions for the specific current-using equipment."
