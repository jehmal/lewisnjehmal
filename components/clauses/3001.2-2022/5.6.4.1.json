    "fullText": "Extra-low voltage wiring systems shall be selected and installed in a connectable electrical installation to meet the following criteria:\n(a) Protect against physical contact with live parts by durable insulation materials or by placing live parts out of reach; and\n(b) satisfy current-carrying capacity, voltage drop and other minimum size requirements for conductors; and\n(c) provide reliability and electrical continuity of connections, joints and terminations; and\n(d) provide adequate strength of supports, suspensions and fixings; and\n(e) suit intended use, including applications requiring a particular type of wiring system; and\n(f) protect against mechanical damage, environmental and other external influences by enclosure or other means; and\n(g) be installed in accordance with the requirements of this section and the additional requirements as specified in the manufacturer's installation instructions.\nWhere there are wiring systems operating at different voltages, cables of low voltage or extra low voltage circuits shall not be enclosed in the same wiring system.\nException: Cables of low voltage circuits and cables of extra‑low voltage circuits shall only be enclosed in the same wiring system where one of the following arrangements is employed:\n(i) The low voltage cables are of a type providing the equivalent of double insulation.\n(ii) All cables or each conductor of a multi‑core cable are insulated for the highest voltage present.\n(iii) The low voltage cables are installed in a separate compartment of a common cable trunking system with fixed and continuous barriers between compartments."
