    "fullText": "Inverter charger units charge batteries when the normal power supply is available and provide a 230 V a.c. power supply when the normal supply or supplementary supply (i.e. generator) is not available. An inverter charger takes d.c. power from a battery or d.c. source and converts it to 230 V a.c.\nSee Figures 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12 for typical inverter charger connection diagrams."
