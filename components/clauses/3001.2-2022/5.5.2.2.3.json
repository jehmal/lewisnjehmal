    "fullText": "Overcurrent protection devices shall be installed at the renewable energy source in the positive conductors.\nPV arrays shall be provided with overcurrent protection as follows:\n(a) Protection against circulating currents within the array — To protect against circulating currents within the array, arrays having 3 or more strings shall be provided with overcurrent protection in each such string.\nThe protective devices shall be —\n(i) located as close as practicable to the string junction point; and\n(ii) rated at no more than 1.5 × the string short-circuit current capacity between strings.\nNOTE 1 A string is 1 or more panels connected in series.\n(b) Overload and short circuit protection of array cables — Each section of the array cables shall be protected against overload.\nNOTE 2 The sections of conductors on the array side and on the battery side of the charge controller need to be considered separately, as they may be operating at different voltage and current levels.\nNOTE 3 Protection of the array side section may be achieved by —\n(i) the rated short circuit current of the array; or\n(ii) the sum of ratings of the string protection overcurrent protection devices; or\n(iii) a separate overcurrent device located on the array side of the charge controller.\nFuses and fuse holders shall comply with Clauses 5.5.2.3.4 and 5.5.2.4."
