    "fullText": "After completion of, or in association with, the visual inspection, tests shall be carried out on the electrical installation to determine that it complies with the requirements of this Standard and that it is suitable for the use intended.\nIf necessary, additional tests may be carried out.\nAS/NZS 3017 sets out common test methods that may be used to determine that a low voltage electrical installation complies with this Standard, and also includes minimum safety standards for test instruments.\nTesting shall be carried out in such a manner that the safety of the operator and other people in the vicinity, and test equipment is not placed at risk.\nNOTE The test methods set out in this clause are given as reference methods. Other methods are not precluded, provided that they give equally valid results.\nLow voltage installations testing shall include the following tests â€”\n(a) Continuity of the earthing system (earth resistance of the main earthing conductor, protective earthing conductors, PEN conductors and bonding conductors).\n(b) Insulation resistance.\n(c) Polarity and correct circuit connections.\n(d) Assessment of impedance required for automatic disconnection of supply (earth fault-loop impedance.\n(e) Operation of RCDs.\nSee Figure 6.1 for the recommended sequence of the above tests.\nIn New Zealand, testing following prescribed electrical work, including removal of the neutral- earth link, shall include testing to ensure the integrity of the earth connections in accordance with Clause D.5.5."
