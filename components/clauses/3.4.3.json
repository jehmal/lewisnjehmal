  "fullText": "Current-carrying capacities for circuits comprising parallel multi-core cables or groups of single-core cables may be determined from the sum of the current-carrying capacity of the various cables connected in parallel provided that the following requirements are met:\n(a) Cables shall be not less than 4 mm2.\n(b) Grouping of cables shall not affect the cooling of each parallel cable, or group, by the ambient air or the ground.\n(c) The load current sharing between each parallel cable or group shall be sufficient to prevent overheating of any cable or group.\nExample:\nEqual load current sharing may be achieved by the selection and installation of cables to give the same impedance for each cable in the group. This condition is satisfied whenâ€”\n(i) conductors are of the same material and cross-sectional area with a minimum size of 4 mm2;\n(ii) cables follow the same route and achieve the same length;\n(iii) conductors of each parallel cable, or group, are effectively joined together at each end; and\n(iv) the relative position of phase and neutral conductors in and between parallel groups takes account of mutual impedance.\nException: Unequal load current sharing between cables or groups may be permitted, in accordance with Part 1 of this Standard, provided that the design current and overcurrent protection requirements for each cable or group are considered individually. IEC 60364-4-43 provides further information on the conditions under which this is permitted.\nNOTE: The AS/NZS 3008.1 series provides recommended circuit configurations for the installation of parallel single-core cables in electrically symmetrical groups. The recommended method is to use trefoil groups containing each of the three phase conductors and neutral in each group.",
