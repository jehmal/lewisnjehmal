    "fullText": "The following protective measures shall be taken:\n(a) The requirements of AS/NZS 5033 shall apply to the protection of PV arrays.\n(b) Overcurrent protection of battery systems shall be of a non-polarized type.\nNOTES:\n1 Attention is drawn to the possibility of the battery providing high currents due to faults in renewable inputs or associated wiring.\n2 The requirements of AS/NZS 3000 and AS 4086.2 state that all overcurrent and overload protective devices shall be in the live (unearthed) conductors and shall be able to safely disconnect the maximum short circuit current at the point of connection.\n3 d.c. switching and overcurrent protection devices need to be appropriately rated for d.c.. Components that are only a.c. rated are not appropriate for d.c. applications. a.c. ratings and d.c. ratings are not equivalent.\n(c) A lightning risk analysis shall be performed.\nInformation on lighting risk analysis is provided in AS 4509.2. Installations in areas determined to be at great or very great risk should be provided with lightning protection if there is a risk of injury to people.\nNOTE: This Standard does not mandate lightning protection for all installations. Reference should be made to AS/NZS 1768 for information that will assist in determining the risk of lightning damage for particular applications and suitable protection methods."
