    "fullText": "The equipment—\n(a) should only be accessible to authorized persons except for access to meters and informative displays, as indicated in Clauses 2.6 and 2.7;\n(b) shall be installed in accordance with manufacturer's instructions; and\nNOTE: The installation of equipment needs to take into account the climatic conditions and the environment in which it is to be installed (e.g. dust, ventilation, vermin etc).\n(c) shall be provided with adequate ventilation for battery gases and vapours. (See AS 4086.2 and Section 7 of this Standard.)\nNOTE: See AS 4086.2 and Section 7 of this Standard.\nWhen designing the layout and/or installing equipment, consideration shall be given to—\n(i) losses in cables (e.g. length of cable runs from the PV array to the battery bank or inverter etc);\n(ii) noise from the equipment (e.g. motors, wind turbines, micro-hydro generators);\n(iii) exhaust gases (e.g. from internal combustion motors or the hydrogen from batteries); and\n(iv) the risk of igniting any fuel storage (see Section 6).\nThe equipment layout should allow for the hydrogen gas that can be produced from the battery when under charge. In particular, the location of devices that could provide an ignition source for hydrogen gas when operating, need to be considered. (For specific requirements see Section 7.)"
