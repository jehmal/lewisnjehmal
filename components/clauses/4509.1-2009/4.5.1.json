    "fullText": "With respect to AS/NZS 3000, the connection of an installation to a stand-alone power system may be considered equivalent to the connection of an installation to a distribution network where control and protection systems are integral to the stand-alone power system.\nTypical layouts and connections with main switchboards are shown in Figures 4.2 to 4.4.\nNOTES:\n1 30 mA type A RCBO provides earth leakage, overload and overcurrent protection for the load.\n2 Neutral connection of stand-alone power supply to be earthed to allow RCBO to operate on earth leakage load.\n3 RCBO can be replaced by RCCB and a MCB.\n4 Use of a Type A RCD may be necessary due to high d.c. component in the inverter waveform or inverter manufacturer's recommendation. In New Zealand, the use of a Type A RCD is mandated.\nFIGURE 4.1 SUPPLY TO A SINGLE LV A.C. LOAD\nNOTES:\n1 MCB for consumers main protection and isolation.\n2 Main earth electrode to AS/NZS 3000 requirements.\nFIGURE 4.2 TYPICAL LAYOUT AND CONNECTIONS WITH MAIN SWITCHBOARD ADJACENT TO STAND-ALONE POWER SYSTEM AND DISTRIBUTION SWITCHBOARD LOCATED REMOTELY\nNOTES:\n1 MCB for consumers main protection and isolation.\n2 Main earth electrode to AS/NZS 3000 requirements.\nFIGURE 4.3 TYPICAL LAYOUT AND CONNECTIONS WITH MAIN SWITCHBOARD LOCAL OR REMOTE FROM STAND-ALONE POWER SYSTEM AND LOADING DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO MAIN SWITCHBOARD\nNOTES:\n1 MCB for consumers main protection and isolation.\n2 Main earth electrode to AS/NZS 3000 requirements.\n3 MEN switchboard submain connections to comply with outbuilding requirements.\nFIGURE 4.4 TYPICAL LAYOUT AND CONNECTIONS WITH MAIN SWITCHBOARD ADJACENT OR REMOTE TO STAND-ALONE POWER SYSTEM AND REMOTE MEN SWITCHBOARD(S) SUPPLIED BY USING OUTBUILDING PROVISIONS"
