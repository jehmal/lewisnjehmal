    "title": "Isolation and protection of consumers mains",
    "fullText": "The consumers mains of the electrical installation shall be connected to the output of the stand-alone power system (i.e. the point of supply). Provision shall be made to isolate the consumers mains when required. The isolation may take the form of one of the following:\n(a) A circuit breaker built into the inverter supplying the stand-alone point of supply.\n(b) An external circuit breaker or removeable fuse external to the inverter.\n(c) In situations where the main switchboard is immediately adjacent to the stand-alone power system, a d.c. circuit breaker on the input to the inverter may be used to provide isolation of the consumers mains. In the case of an interactive inverter, isolation of the generating set input shall also be provided.\nNOTE: 'Immediately adjacent' is considered to be within 2 m and the inverter is visible from the switchboard (i.e. not in separate rooms).\nThe over-current protection device at the output of the stand-alone power system shall be rated to protect the consumers mains.\nNOTES:\n1 The sizing of the consumers mains should take into account the allowable voltage drop for an installation as specified in AS/NZS 3000, where the 'point of supply' is taken as the output of the stand-alone power system and the current used for voltage drop calculations should be the current rating of the over-current protection device at the output of the stand-alone power system.\n2 Where the main switchboard is adjacent to the stand-alone power system, the consumers mains may be very short.\nWhen installing aerial lines the requirements of AS/NZS 3000 apply."
