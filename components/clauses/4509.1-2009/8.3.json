    "fullText": "All battery chargers shall be connected to the battery bank by fixed wiring via the main battery fuse or circuit breaker. If the main battery fuse or circuit breaker will not provide overcurrent protection for the battery charger output wiring, the battery charger output cabling shall be protected from overcurrent by separate HRC fusing or a d.c. rated circuit breaker adjacent to the main battery fuse or circuit breaker. The battery charger shall be fitted with a fuse or circuit breaker to provide an isolating point and battery charger overcurrent protection."
