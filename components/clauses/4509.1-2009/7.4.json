    "fullText": "Battery protection equipment (e.g. fuses and circuit breakers) should be mounted outside the battery enclosure but as close as possible to the battery enclosure (to minimize cable length).\nWhere overcurrent protection equipment is mounted in the battery enclosure, the equipment shall be mounted a minimum of 100 mm below the battery terminals or a minimum of 500 mm horizontally from the batteries.\nNOTE: Overcurrent protection equipment in the battery enclosure should be located to minimize the risk of being splashed when topping up battery electrolyte.\nIf battery systems comprise two or more strings in parallel then the cables connecting the strings should be of equal length and equal cross-sectional area.\nAll unprotected and unearthed cablesâ€”\n(a) not exceeding 2 m in length;\n(b) used for the connection of a battery terminal and the battery overcurrent device; and\n(c) contained in a battery enclosure, battery room or in a screened off area specifically allocated for batteries\ndo not require additional mechanical protection.\nFor cables exceeding 2 m, the cables shall be protected by PVC conduit or equivalent protection.\nAll unprotected and unearthed cables described in (b) above that exit the areas described in (c) above shall be mechanically protected by PVC conduit or equivalent, if located within a zone of arm's reach.\nNOTE: The zone of arm's reach is defined in AS/NZS 3000."
