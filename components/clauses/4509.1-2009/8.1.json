    "fullText": "Regulators, and associated temperature sensors where provided, shall be installed according to manufacturer's instructions.\nNOTE: Ambient air temperature is not a reliable indicator of battery electrolyte temperature and hence temperature sensors should be installed such that they measure battery electrolyte or battery mass temperature (e.g. by mounting the sensor on the terminal or fixing the sensor to the side of the cell casing)."
