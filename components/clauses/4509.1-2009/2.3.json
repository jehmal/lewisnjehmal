    "fullText": "Signs shallâ€”\n(a) be sufficiently durable for their purpose;\n(b) be constructed of appropriate and durable materials suitable for the location;\n(c) be fixed in a durable manner appropriate for the location;\n(d) be in English;\n(e) be legible and the letter size to be appropriate for the location;\n(f) be indelible; and\n(g) be visible when applicable.\nNOTES:\n1 Most signs should not be obscured by being located inside cupboards, behind doors or other materials. Signs should not be obscured by having materials placed in front of them or be located where it is likely that material will be placed in front of them (e.g. immediately above a shelf). It should be noted that signs like the battery signs may be inside the battery enclosure and hence may only become visible after opening the battery enclosure.\n2 As a guide, sign lettering is sized with upper case lettering of 5 mm high and lower case of 4 mm high per metre of viewing distance."
