    "fullText": "Electric current that flows in one direction only. This type of current flow is generally produced from a battery or from rectified a.c.\nNOTE: Current carrying capacity for d.c. cables can be determined by reference to AS 3008.1.1 as the heating effect for d.c. currents is identical to the r.m.s value for a.c. currents. Voltage drops for d.c. currents can be calculated using AS/NZS 1125."
