  "title": "Devices for protection against both overload and short-circuit currents",
  "fullText": "*\tProtective devices providing protection against both overload and short- circuit current shall be capable of breaking any overcurrent up to and including the prospective short-circuit current at the point where the device is installed.\nThe device shall comply with the requirements of Clauses 2.5.3 and 2.5.4.\nException: A protective device having a breaking capacity below the value of the prospective short-circuit current may be used in conjunction with another device in accordance with Clause 2.5.7.2.\nProtective devices may be one of the following:\n(a)\tCircuit-breakers incorporating short-circuit and overload releases.\n(b)\tFuse-combination units (CFS units).\n(c)\tFuses having enclosed fuse-links (HRC fuses).\n(d)\tCircuit-breakers in conjunction with fuses. Semi-enclosed rewireable fuses shall not be used.\nNOTES:\n1\tGeneral-purpose fuses (Type gG) and overcurrent circuit-breakers normally combine overload and short-circuit protection in the one device.\n2\tA fuse comprises all the parts that form the complete protective device.\n3\tCircuit-breakers that meet the requirements for the type of protection required and replace a fuse-carrier by insertion in a fuse base are acceptable. However, because of interchangeability with semi-enclosed rewireable fuse-carriers, such circuit-breakers should be rated at not more than 80% of the current-carrying capacity of the protected conductor.\n4\tScrew-type fuses of the enclosed type that meet the requirements of IEC 60269-3 System A Type D are acceptable."
