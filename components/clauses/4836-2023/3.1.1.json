  "fullText": "Work shall not be carried out on or near de-energized exposed conductors and parts until a competent person has â€”\n(a) positively identified the electrical equipment and conductors, all energy sources and the isolation points in accordance with Clause 3.1.2;\n(b) isolated electrical equipment and conductors from all energy sources in accordance with Clause 3.1.3;\n(c) secured the isolation in accordance with Clause 3.1.4;\n(d) discharged any stored energy, where necessary, e.g. within capacitors in accordance with Clause 4.3.2;\n(e) proven the de-energization of all relevant electrical equipment and conductors in accordance with Clause 3.1.5;\n(f) identified the limits of the safe area of work in accordance with Clause 3.1.7; and\n(g) displayed warning notices to reduce the risk of injury or death (see example below).\nWARNING: ALL ELECTRICAL CONDUCTORS AND PARTS, INCLUDING NEUTRAL AND EARTHING CONDUCTORS, SHALL BE TREATED AS ENERGIZED UNTIL PROVEN DE-ENERGIZED.
