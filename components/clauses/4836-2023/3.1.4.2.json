  "fullText": "Personal padlocks should be used for locking isolating devices. They should be red in colour and uniquely keyed to prevent inadvertent removal by others.\nEach personal padlock should identify the person's name, company, and contact details. This may be achieved by either engraving on the padlock or by attaching a personal identification tag to it.\nA multi‑lock device that is suitable for the isolator shall be employed where more than one person is required to attach a personal lock to an isolator.\nFigure 3.1(A) shows a typical lock and multi‑lock device. Figure 3.1(B) shows a typical personal identification tag."
