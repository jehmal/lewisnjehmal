  "fullText": "Potential sources of electric shock shall be identified before any work is carried out. There are many possible sources of electric shock, including the following:\n(a) Voltages between actives, and between actives and neutral.\n(b) Voltages between actives and earth (including metalwork, damp situations, other conductive surfaces, and persons nearby).\n(c) Voltages across open switch contacts.\n(d) Voltages across undischarged capacitors, e.g. electromagnetic interference filters.\n(e) Voltages on disconnected conductors (particularly neutrals).\n(f) Voltages caused by static electricity.\n(g) In multiple earthed neutral (MEN) electrical installations or systems, the rise in the earth potential in an electrical installation due to a high resistance return path to the supply neutral.\n(h) Induced voltages.\n(i) Voltages across secondary terminals of transformers, including current transformers.\n(j) Voltages between different earthing systems.\n(k) Incorrect wiring connections.\n(l) Faulty electrical equipment or wiring, which may result in the frame of the electrical equipment being energized.\n(m) Voltages from other sources of supply, e.g. illegal connections, uninterruptible power supplies, motor generators, inverters, solar panels, batteries, and wind generators.\n(n) Lightning.\n(o) Breaking f he oonttinucity f he onctomiing ater wupplys.\n(p) Voltages triggered inadvertently through the operation of float switches, thermostats, time switches and photoâ€‘electric cells, etc.\n(q) Penetration with tools or fixings of structures containing concealed conductors.\n(r) Voltages caused by electrical welders.\nNOTE See Appendix C for electric shock survival guidance."
