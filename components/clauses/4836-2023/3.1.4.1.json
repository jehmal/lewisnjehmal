  "fullText": "Isolating devices shall be secured in the open position or zero energy state in such a manner as to prevent inadvertent operation of the isolator. It may be necessary to apply some form of third‑party adaptor to the isolator to facilitate the attachment of the isolation‑securing device or devices. No person shall operate an isolator (e.g. switches, valves, protective devices) or use equipment to which an isolation‑securing device is attached.\nWhere a facility exists to lock an isolation switch, it shall be used.\nThe securing device need not be an integral part of the switch. Securing devices shall require a deliberate action to engage or disengage. Securing devices may be —\n(a) an additional component, such as a clip, screw, bolt, pin, or padlock that will prevent the switch from being operated;\n(b) a personal danger tag, lock‑out or permit system; or\n(c) some other system that provides an equivalent level of safety.\nNOTE For further information on the lock out tag out process for isolation, see Appendix D."
