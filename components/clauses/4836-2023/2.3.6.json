  "fullText": "Other potential sources of risk shall be identified before any work is carried out. Potential sources of risk include the following:\n(a) Live conductors.\n(b) Adjacent live conductors such as —\n(i) concealed conductors, e.g. they can be present within building cavities and slabs, concealed by earth (dirt) or other material;\n(ii) overhead conductors (see Section 5); and\n(iii) underground conductors (see Section 6).\n(c) Cramped working conditions.\n(d) Confined spaces.\n(e) Multiple sources of supply including stored or generating sources, e.g. solar, wind, co‑gen, battery banks, uninterruptible power supply (UPS), inverters and capacitors.\n(f) Damp situations.\n(g) Environmental factors, e.g. heat, cold, vibration and noise.\n(h) Height, e.g. working at heights and danger of falling objects.\n(i) Operational pressures to carry out work or to restore electricity supply.\n(j) Instability of the work area.\n(k) Conductors, cables or equipment under tension or likely to fall.\n(l) Proximity of other work functions and other mobile plant and equipment including moving machinery such as gantry cranes or transfer cars.\n(m) Working below ground.\n(n) Corrosive and toxic materials.\n(o) Radiation, e.g. microwave antennas, radio towers, mobile phone antennas, and radar.\n(p) Material containing asbestos.\n(q) Hazardous substances, e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (see Clause 4.3.11).\n(r) Accumulation of conductive dust.\n(s) Failure to comply with practices and procedures.\n(t) Working in isolation from others.\n(u) Equipment design, e.g. not operating switches under load unless they are designed for the purpose.\n(v) Position of exposed energized conductors or live conductive parts."
