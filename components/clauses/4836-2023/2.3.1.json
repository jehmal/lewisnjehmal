  "fullText": "The first step of the risk management process is to identify the factors that have the potential to cause harm.\nBefore undertaking work, all hazards and environmental considerations shall be identified.\nHazard identification is the process used to identify all possible conditions, situations, practices, and behaviours in the workplace where people may be exposed to injury, illness or disease, or when damage may be done to the environment, property, plant or equipment.\nExamples of hazards and environmental considerations include the following:\n(a) Electric shock.\n(b) Arc flash.\n(c) Position of exposed energized conductors or live conductive parts.\nWARNING: ALL ELECTRICAL CONDUCTORS AND PARTS, INCLUDING NEUTRAL AND EARTHING CONDUCTORS, SHALL BE TREATED AS ENERGIZED UNTIL PROVEN DE-ENERGIZED. ALWAYS TEST BEFORE TOUCHING.\n(d) Cramped conditions.\n(e) Moving equipment, such as cranes or transfer cars.\n(f) Hot or wet conditions.\n(g) Hazardous areas (see Clause 4.3.3).\nNOTE All non-electrical sources of energy (e.g. counterweights on machines and stored hydraulic and pneumatic energy) should be isolated, controlled or secured to prevent the release of energy. The AS/NZS 4024 series provides guidance on the safeguarding of machinery."
