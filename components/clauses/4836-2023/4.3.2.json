  "fullText": "When working on electrical installations or equipment that includes capacitors, substantial energy can be present even when they are de-energized. In such circumstances, voltages might be produced that could cause electrocution, arcs, flash burns or electric shock to persons, or ignite gases or solid material.\nCapacitors and associated circuitry shall be proved to be de-energized and fully discharged before commencing work on them and their associated circuit wiring. This may be achieved by using and maintaining, for the duration of the work, safe discharging devices or by following the instructions for use. A voltage tester shall be used to prove that the capacitors are discharged, immediately before performing work, because capacitors that do not have discharge devices attached might reinstate the full line voltage. The voltage tests shall be on the d.c. scale of the tester.\nIf a capacitor is not discharged, then the requirements of Clause 4.3.1 for work on or near exposed energized conductors or live conductive parts shall apply.\nNOTE Further discharge requirements are specified in AS/NZS 3000.\nSteps should be taken against the harmful effects of arcing when applying discharging devices. Short-circuiting or earthing of capacitor terminals with metal objects such as spanners or screwdrivers can result in electrocution, arcs, flash burns or electric shock and should not be attempted. Use only devices that are suitable for the work to be carried out."
