  "fullText": "Before work is commenced on or near any electrical installation or equipment, a competent person shall determine whether it is safe to do so. This is achieved by applying a risk management system. All work shall be planned and organized to minimize the risk associated with the work.\nThe most effective way to control risk is to eliminate it. If a risk assessment indicates that risks cannot be sufficiently controlled to enable the work to be performed safely, then the work shall not proceed.\nThis section sets out the principles of risk management for the identification and assessment of risk. It also provides information regarding means of reducing risk and the work permit system.\nNOTE 1 AS ISO 31000 provides guidance on the establishment and implementation of the risk management process.\nNOTE 2 AS/NZS 4804 provides guidance on the development and implementation of occupational health and safety management systems.\nNOTE 3 Appendix E provides information on a risk assessment technique involving a bowtie analysis."
