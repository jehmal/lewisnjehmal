  "fullText": "Extreme care should be exercised when the following items are encountered near live electrical equipment:\n(a) Earth situations.\n(b) Earth wires.\n(c) Conductive fittings and brackets.\n(d) Concrete or metal poles and structures.\nWhen working on isolated low‑voltage lines supported by conductive poles or structures, the lines shall be (temporarily) electrically connected to each pole or structure.\nThis requirement applies also to wood poles with exposed earth downleads or other exposed earth bonding conductors (except low‑voltage neutrals).\nThis requirement does not apply to the following:\n(i) If the line is treated as live and live working procedures are adopted.\n(ii) If work is carried out from an insulated EWP positioned so that simultaneous contact with the pole and any conductor is avoided.\n(iii) If the exposed conductive equipment, such as earth downleads, may be effectively covered with insulating covers to prevent inadvertent contact between different potentials."
