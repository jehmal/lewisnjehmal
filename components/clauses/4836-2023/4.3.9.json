  "title": "ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE â€” INDUCED VOLTAGE",
  "fullText": "Electromotive force (EMF) is generated when magnetic field fluctuations occur through a surface. Devices that can generate EMF include solar cells, electrical generators, transformers, and thermoelectric devices (typically used in heating and cooling systems). EMF is generated in the vicinity of power lines, mobile phones, mobile phone tower and similar transmitters.\nSymptoms experienced by a person who is sensitive to EMF can include headaches, sleeping disorders, depression, aches and pains.\nThe following controls can reduce the risk of EMF:\n(a) Design of the layout of the work environment or location.\n(b) Use of barriers, signs and other similar systems.\n(c) Use of equipment that emits less intense EMF.\n(d) Limit on the duration of the exposure."
