  "title": "PRECAUTIONS BEFORE WORKING ON POLES OR STRUCTURES",
  "fullText": "Climbing a pole should only be performed as a last resort. This would be after considering other work and heights controls and being able to justify why a lower‑order work at heights control has been used over higher‑order controls such as EWPs.\nA person shall not climb a pole or structure unless they have —\n(a) authorization, training and competence to carry out the work;\n(b) performed a safe‑to‑climb assessment and there is no danger of collapse of the pole or structure during the course of the work;\nNOTE 1 Poles should be risk assessed for structural integrity prior to climbing. Wooden poles which have been in service for 25 years or more may need to be reinforced at the ground line with steel members, either before climbing or where the structural forces acting on them are increased.\nNOTE 2 Particular care should be taken with poles whose loading conditions are to be significantly changed during the course of the work, e.g. made freestanding or have the tensions in any direction increased or decreased.\n(c) confirmed minimum safe approach distances to other live circuits that are on or near the pole are maintained, or that action has been taken so that other circuits are de-energized;\n(d) safety equipment, which may include fall‑arrest systems and devices and pole top rescue kits available on site where work is being performed; and\n(e) a safety observer present, if risk assessment has identified the need for one.\nNOTE 3 The relevant authority may require emergency rescue procedures to be in place in the event that a pole‑top rescue needs to be carried out.\nNOTE 4 The age of poles is calculated from the date of original installation."
