  "fullText": "Cutting cables or wiring enclosures shall not proceed until processes are followed and tests are performed that prove the cable is isolated prior to cutting. Where isolation of the conductors within a cable or wiring enclosure cannot be conclusively proven â€”\n(a) the cable or wiring enclosure shall be presumed to include live conductors; and\n(b) a SWMS shall be undertaken.\nWARNING: NON-CONTACT AND SINGLE-CONTACT VOLTAGE INDICATORS SHALL NOT BE RELIED ON FOR PROVING THAT NO HAZARDOUS VOLTAGE IS PRESENT, AND THAT THE WIRING OR FITTINGS HAVE BEEN DE-ENERGIZED AND/OR ISOLATED TO A SAFE STATE. A DUAL-CONTACT VOLTAGE INDICATOR IS REQUIRED FOR THIS FUNCTION."
