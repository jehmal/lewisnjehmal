  "title": "ISOLATION OF ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT",
  "fullText": "The electrical equipment to be worked on shall be isolated from all sources of electrical supply either by opening switches, removing fuses or links, opening circuit breakers, or removing circuit connections.\nProcedures shall be adopted to identify alternative power supplies connected to the electrical installation.\nNOTE 1 Alternative sources of supply may include inverter/UPS systems, standby generators, solar cells, neutral backfeed from intermixed circuits, ring main systems, main power with separate auxiliary power supplies for control, transformation up (backfeed from ELV controls), multiple control supplies, luminaires supplied from emergency sources of supply, and batteries.\nControl circuits or control systems (such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), emergency stops, control selector switches) shall not be used as a means of isolation, e.g. by operation of a stop button.\nWARNING: CIRCUIT WIRING OF ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT OR CONDUCTORS MAY BECOME ENERGIZED DUE TO ANY OPERATION OF AUTOMATIC CONTROL DEVICES, E.G. THERMOSTATS, SWITCHES, PLCs, AND OTHER INTERFACE DEVICES.\nNOTE 2 When removing circuit connections, active conductors should be disconnected first, followed by neutral conductors. Earth conductors should be disconnected last."
