Test equipment shall comply with the following:\n(a) When used in hazardous areas, test equipment shall be clearly marked as being suitable for use in such locations.\n(b) Test probes, leads and other equipment shall be selected so that they cannot inadvertently short-circuit between energized conductors or live conductive parts, and energized conductors or live conductive parts and earth.\n(c) The terminals of test equipment shall be shrouded when testing whether they are de-energized.\nNOTE 1 Measuring instruments should be designed to prevent inadvertent contact with any energized test sockets, conductors or both when the equipment is in use.\nNOTE 2 Clause 3.1.8 specifies requirements for proving de-energization.\nNOTE 3 AS 61010.1 provides a classification for instruments. Devices should be rated as Category III or IV to enable their use on all parts of the electrical installation.\nNOTE 4 Refer to HB 187 for guidance on selecting multimeters."
