  "fullText": "This document outlines principles, guidelines and procedures for safe work by electrical and nonelectrical workers on or near low‑voltage and extra‑low voltage electrical installations and equipment.\nIt provides a minimum set of guidelines, procedures, safety requirements and recommendations to manage the hazards associated with electricity, specifically arc blast, arc flash, electric shock, and electrocution. Adopting the requirements will provide a safe environment for work on or near lowvoltage as well as for extra‑low voltage electrical installations and equipment.\nThis document covers general risk management and mitigation principles for determining the controls to be implemented to provide a safe working environment.\nThis document applies to all electrical and non‑electrical workers carrying out work on or work near low‑voltage and extra‑low voltage electrical installations and equipment for both a.c. and d.c..\nNOTE The general principles of this document may be applied in the risk management of other voltages outside this range where specific procedures and documents are not available.\nIn New Zealand, these practices may also apply to work carried out on or near works.\nWarning disclaimers are used in this document where there is potential for injury or death to the user.
