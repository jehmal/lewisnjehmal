  "title": "PROTECTION",
  "fullText": "Protection shall be provided by supplying all portable electrical tools, appliances and equipment through an RCD or through an isolating transformer. Isolating transformers shall comply with the AS/NZS 61558 series. The secondary winding shall not be connected to the primary winding or earthed.\nWhen in use, portable RCDs or isolating transformers should be as close as practicable to the point of supply, e.g. at the supply end of an extension lead and not at the appliance end.\nRCDs do not provide protection —\n(a) if there is no current path to earth or if the portable electric tool comes in contact with an alternative source of electricity, e.g. a drill bit contacting an embedded electrical conductor in a wall, floor or ceiling;\n(b) against electric shock or electrocution from between the electrode and return leads when welding;\nNOTE 1 AS 1674.2 and Safe Work Australia's Welding Processes Code of Practice, July 2020 specify requirements for welding.\n(c) where the current leakage path is from active to neutral or phase to phase; or\n(d) for a portable electric tool supplied from an isolating transformer or isolated winding generator.\nNOTE 2 RCDs do not prevent electric shock but are designed to reduce the likelihood of electrocution by disconnecting the supply to safeguard the user.\nNOTE 3 RCDs do not provide protection on all types of supply. Whether or not an RCD performs satisfactorily on a given supply depends on the type of RCD.\nIsolating transformers do not provide protection —\n(i) if the secondary winding is earthed;\n(ii) if the portable electric tool comes in contact with an alternative source of electricity, e.g. a drill bit contacting an embedded electrical conductor in a wall, floor or ceiling;\n(iii) against electric shock from between the electrode and return leads when welding; or\n(iv) where the current leakage path is between live conductors."
