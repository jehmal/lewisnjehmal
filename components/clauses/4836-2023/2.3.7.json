  "title": "WORK ZONE",
  "fullText": "If any person is required to work within 3 m of energized exposed conductors or parts, a competent person shall identify appropriate risk treatments (see Figure 2.1).\nSafety shall not be compromised because of operational pressures to carry out the work.\nFigure 2.2 depicts the 500 mm work zone for work on low-voltage (LV) and extra-low voltage (ELV) equipment within an enclosed switchboard panel. The 500 mm work zone is shown in the circle.\nEnergized conductors and live conductive parts do not pose a significant risk when the door of the cabinet in which they are contained is closed. Therefore, when the cabinet door is closed, the internal components are not considered to be part of the work zone and may remain energized even if they are within the exclusion zone depicted in Figure 2.1.\nNOTE 1 In some cases, the identification and possibility of encroaching within 3 m of energized exposed conductors or parts will be obvious, e.g. overhead lines and cables and crane collector rails. In other cases, it will not be immediately obvious, e.g. power tools drilling into structures (see Clause 8.3). Work equipment may extend into the 3 m distance, e.g. with ladders (see Clause 8.4).\nNOTE 2 Appendix A provides a typical form for use in the assessment of risk.\nWARNING: INFORMATION REGARDING ALL HAZARDS AND THE CONTROL MEASURES REQUIRED FOR MITIGATION SHALL BE READILY AVAILABLE."
