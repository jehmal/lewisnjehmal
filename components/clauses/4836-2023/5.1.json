  "fullText": "A minimum safe distance from overhead conductors and lines shall be maintained to avoid contact, shock or injury. The safe distance shall be determined before work commences.\nExtra caution should be exercised when working on or near exposed energized overhead conductors or other energized electrical equipment in elevated positions. In elevated positions, even a slight shock could result in a potentially fatal fall. Fallâ€‘arrest systems and devices and other necessary safety equipment and PPE shall be used. If the work requires a safety observer, they shall be skilled in rescue procedures.\nPoles and structures shall be tested and inspected to establish, as far as practicable, whether they are structurally sound for the work to be carried out. The testing and inspection shall be performed before climbing the poles or structures or accessing them by means of EWPs. EWPs should be used whenever practicable.\nNOTE AS/NZS 1891 contains requirements for fall-arrest devices and AS 2550.10 contains requirements for EWPs."
