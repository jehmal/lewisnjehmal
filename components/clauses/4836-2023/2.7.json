  "title": "MEANS OF REDUCING RISK",
  "fullText": "A person should maximize electrical safety where possible when working with electrical installations or equipment. Electrical safety is inversely proportional to the level of risk and depends on â€”\n(a) appropriate job planning by a competent person;\n(b) correct isolation and testing procedures and techniques;\n(c) use of safety equipment and tools, test instruments and PPE that are fit for purpose;\n(d) work being carried out by competent persons;\n(e) display of warning notices to reduce the risk of injury or death; and\n(f) use of barriers to prevent inadvertent contact with energized parts.\nWARNING: ALL ELECTRICAL CONDUCTORS AND PARTS, INCLUDING NEUTRAL AND EARTHING CONDUCTORS, SHALL BE TREATED AS ENERGIZED UNTIL PROVEN DE-ENERGIZED. ALWAYS TEST BEFORE TOUCHING.\nWork should be planned in advance, particularly where other services are likely to be present or affected, e.g. gas, telephone, data communications, water pipes, other electrical circuits, other energy sources, and where other trades are likely to be working.\nWork should be planned to avoid jeopardizing the operation of lighting and electrical equipment essential for safety or for the preservation of life, e.g. emergency lighting and dialysis machines."
