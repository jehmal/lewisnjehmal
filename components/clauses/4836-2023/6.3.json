  "fullText": "When excavating cables or working in areas known to contain cables or other services, these cables shall always be treated as energized until proven otherwise.\nNOTE The relevant authority may specify requirements for excavation of and near to cables and services.\nExcavation shall be carried out with extreme caution. Cables might not be protected by a wiring enclosure and might not be provided with a warning tape. Excavation shall be preceded by a site assessment and be carried out in accordance with the following:\n(a) A safety observer shall observe with the sole task of continually guiding the excavator so that it keeps clear of and does not make contact with or cause damage to any cables.\n(b) Jackhammers or crowbars shall not be used to excavate cables due to the risk of cable penetration.\n(c) Mechanical excavation shall be only with a toothless bucket, down to the wiring enclosure or warning tape.\n(d) The final excavation to expose a cable shall be with non-invasive excavation methods, i.e. hand tools or hydro/vacuum excavation only."
