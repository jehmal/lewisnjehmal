  "title": "TEMPORARY BONDING OF CONDUCTORS",
  "fullText": "Where the work risk assessment identifies the need for temporary bonding, the conductors shall be bonded together and connected to the general mass of earth at the work site. Bonding to earth may be effected by connecting conductors to the earthing system with conductors that are adequate to carry the prospective short‑circuit currents to the electrical installation earthing system. The cross‑sectional area of the conductor should be flexible and not less than 6 mm2.\nTemporary bonding conductors shall always be connected together and attached to the general mass of earth before any attempt is made to attach them to any de-energized component of the electrical installation.\nPPE suitable for work involving attaching or removing temporary bonding conductors shall be used.\nNOTE Suitable PPE is specified in Section 11."
