  "fullText": "Any device for the provision of additional protection shall be capable of interrupting the part of the circuit protected by the device when an earth leakage current is above a predetermined value.\n\nThe load current rating of an RCD shall be not less than the greater of the following:\n(a) The maximum demand of the portion of the electrical installation being protected by the device.\n(b) The highest current rating of any overload protective device on the portion of the electrical installation being protected.\n\nNo earthing or protective bonding conductor shall pass through the magnetic circuit of an RCD.\n\nRCDs shall be so selected, and the electrical circuits so subdivided, that any earth leakage current that may be expected to occur during normal operation of the connected load or loads will be unlikely to cause unnecessary tripping of the device.\n\nNOTES:\n1. To avoid unwanted tripping because of leakage currents and transient disturbances, care should be taken to ensure that the sum of the leakage currents of electrical equipment on the load side of an RCD is significantly less than its rated residual current. RCDs may operate at any value of residual current in excess of 50% of the rated residual current. The loading of the circuit should be such that the leakage current does not exceed one-third of the rated residual current.\n2. To avoid excessive leakage current causing unwanted tripping where socket-outlets are protected by one RCD having a rated residual current not greater than 30 mA, consideration should be given to the number of socket-outlets protected and the nature of electrical equipment likely to be connected to the socket-outlets."
