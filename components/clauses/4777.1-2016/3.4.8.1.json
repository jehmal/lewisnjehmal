  "fullText": "The export control for an IES is used to control the generation from an IES and amount of energy exported from an electrical installation to the grid. The export control function may be integrated into the inverter or an external device.\n\nThe export control function for an IES may operate with the following export limits:\n(a) Hard limit: A limit that will require the IES to disconnect.\n(b) Soft limit: A limit that will cause the IES to reduce its output, preventing ongoing export greater than the limit.\n\nThe export limit may be specified as kVA and/or kW. Where the export limit is in kVA or kW, it shall apply to the total export from the electrical installation.\n\nThe export limit may be set to allow export to the grid or to provide a minimum import load from the grid. The soft limit may be utilized with the hard limit to minimize the number of disconnections due to exceeding the hard limit. Where both hard and soft limits are used, the requirements for the hard limit shall take precedence over the soft limit requirements.\n\nThe export control device settings shall be secured against inadvertent or unauthorized tampering. Changes to settings shall require the use of a tool and special instructions not provided to unauthorized personnel.\n\nNOTE: Special interface devices and passwords are regarded as tools."
