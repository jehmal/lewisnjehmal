  "fullText": "Cabling for a.c. energy sources shall comply with the requirements of AS/NZS 3000 and the AS/NZS 3008.1 series.\n\nCabling for PV arrays shall comply with the requirements of AS/NZS 5033.\n\nCabling for d.c. energy sources other than PV arrays shall comply with AS/NZS 3000 and all of the following requirements:\n(a) Be suitable for d.c. application.\n(b) Have a voltage rating equal to or greater than the rated maximum energy source d.c. voltage.\n(c) Have a temperature rating in accordance with the application.\n(d) If exposed to the environment, be UV-resistant, or be protected from UV light by appropriate protection, or be installed in UV-resistant wiring enclosures (refer to AS/NZS 2053.1 or AS/NZS 61386.1).\nNOTE: AS/NZS 2053.1 requires that conduit suitable for use in direct sunlight be marked with the letter 'T'.\n(e) Be water resistant.\n(f) Be flexible (multi-stranded) to allow for thermal/wind/seismic movement of the energy source.\nNOTE: For LV systems, tinned copper is recommended to reduce degradation of the cable over time.\n(g) In all systems operating at voltages above ELV, cables shall be selected so as to minimize the risk of earth faults and short-circuits. This is commonly achieved using double-insulated cables, particularly for cables that are exposed or laid in a metallic cable tray or wiring enclosure.\n\nAll d.c. cables should be installed so that positive and negative cables of individual circuits are bundled together, avoiding the creation of wiring loops in the system. This recommendation for avoidance of loops and bundling includes any associated earthing/bonding conductors."
