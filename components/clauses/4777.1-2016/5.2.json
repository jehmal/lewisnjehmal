  "title": "SEGREGATION OF CIRCUITS",
  "fullText": "In addition to the requirements detailed in AS/NZS 3000, segregation shall be provided between d.c. and a.c. circuits within enclosures such that connections and pathways are physically segregated from each other by an insulating barrier(s). D.C. wiring shall not be installed or pass through a.c. switchboards or enclosures unless segregated by means of an insulating barrier, such as conduit or trunking.\n\nWhere devices such as switches for circuits requiring segregation are mounted on a common mounting rail in an enclosure, this rail shall not be metallic or conductive.\n\nSegregation insulation barriers between the d.c. and a.c. circuits shall be equivalent to double insulation for the highest voltage level present and appropriate for the installation environment.\n\nThe different types of circuits shall be clearly identified (e.g. by labels and, where possible, by use of different coloured cables).\n\nOutside of enclosures, a separation of 50 mm or a segregation insulation barrier between a.c. and d.c. circuits shall be provided.\n\nSegregation insulation barriers between the d.c. and a.c. circuits shall be to the appropriate level for the installation environment and not less than IP4X."
