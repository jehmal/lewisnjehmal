  "fullText": "The voltage rise requirements of this Clause (3.3.3) apply in addition to the voltage drop requirements of AS/NZS 3000. Under normal service conditions, the voltage at the terminals of any power consuming electrical equipment shall not be greater than the higher limit specified in the relevant electrical equipment Standard. Where the electrical equipment concerned is not covered by a Standard, the voltage at the terminals shall be such as not to impair the safe functioning of the electrical equipment.\n\nAll existing and new cabling shall be designed and checked for the maximum voltage rise between the electricity distributor's point of supply and the inverter a.c. terminals (grid-interactive port) in accordance with the following requirements. The overall voltage rise from the point of supply to the inverter a.c. terminals (grid-interactive port) shall not exceed 2% of the nominal voltage at the point of supply. The value of the current used for the calculation of voltage rise shall be the rated current of the IES. All IES within the electrical installation shall be considered.\n\nNOTE: Refer to Appendix C for examples.\n\nIn the case of a group of inverters with a rating of no more than 5 kVA per phase (see Clause 5.5.2), calculations shall be based on the location where the interconnecting cable connects into the fixed installation wiring.\n\nNOTE: For an aggregate IES rating larger than 30 kVA, the minimum load of the site can be taken into account in calculation of voltage rise at point of supply. For example, the known minimum load from a 12 month period for the entire site, or a factor of 0.7 of the constant minimum load may be used."
