  "fullText": "The soft limit of an export control function may apply to all types of IES.\n\nIn addition to the general requirements for export control functions, the following is required for the soft limit:\n(a) Where the limit is in total kVA, or total kW for multi-phase systems, this shall be the net amount at the point of supply across all phases.\nNOTE: In all systems, the export control function should monitor the export on each phase.\n(b) Where the net export limit is exceeded, the export control function shall operate to ensure the IES meets the export conditions within 15 seconds.\n(c) If the IES and/or export control function loses its connection with the external device, the IES shall reduce IES output, to the limit setting as a maximum. The connection shall be re-established and stable for a minimum of 60 seconds before the export control function is restored.\n\nIf the export control function is required to have a soft limit, it shall detect any fault or loss of operability of the export control function and reduce IES active power output to zero.\n\nNOTE: The provisions of this Clause apply 18 months after the publication of this Standard."
