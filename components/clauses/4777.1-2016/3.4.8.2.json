  "title": "HARD LIMIT",
  "fullText": "The hard limit of an export control function may apply to an IES that has a capacity greater than 30 kVA. In addition to the general requirements for the export control function, the following is required for the hard limit:\n(a) Where the limit is in total kVA, or total kW for multi-phase systems, this shall be the net amount at the point of supply across all phases.\nNOTE: The export function should monitor the export on each phase.\n(b) In both single and three-phase systems, the export function shall monitor the export on each phase.\n(c) Where the export control function is in an external device, the following applies:\n(i) Where the net export limit is exceeded, the export control function shall ensure the IES has completed operating the disconnection device within two seconds. The IES may reduce the output below the net export limit within the two seconds to avoid disconnection.\n(ii) If the IES loses its connection with the export control device, the IES shall operate its disconnection device. The connection to the export control device shall be re-established and stable before the IES is reconnected.\n(d) Where the export control function is integrated into the inverter, the following applies:\n(i) Where the net export limit is exceeded, the export control function shall be used to disconnect the IES and cease exporting within two seconds.\n(ii) If the IES loses its connection with external devices required for the export control function, the IES shall operate its disconnection device. The connection to external devices shall be re-established and achieve stable operation before the IES is reconnected.\n\nIf the export control function is required to have a hard limit, it shall detect any fault or loss of operability of the export control function and operate the disconnection device."
