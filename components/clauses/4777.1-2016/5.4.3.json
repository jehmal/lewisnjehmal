  "title": "CIRCUIT ARRANGEMENT",
  "fullText": "For a multiple mode IES with stand-alone functionality, the final subcircuits of the multiple mode inverter should be located in a separate stand-alone supply load centre or distribution switchboard. Where the stand-alone supply is used as an alternative supply for the electrical installation, the alternative supply arrangements of AS/NZS 3000 shall be applied. All sources of supply associated with multiple mode IES shall be clearly identified and uniquely labelled.\n\nThere shall be a main switch for the stand-alone port of the multiple mode IES.\n\nAll cabling from the multiple mode IES shall be protected against overcurrent in accordance with AS/NZS 3000. Overcurrent protection device ratings shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nWhen operating in stand-alone mode, the stand-alone port shall provide an earth referenced a.c. supply. Where the IES stand-alone functionality requires a double pole (switching both active and neutral), the minimum voltage rating of the changeover device shall be at least twice the a.c. supply voltage.\n\nNOTE: Design notes for this arrangement are given in Appendix B.\n\nThe provision of AS/NZS 3000 for the use of RCDs as a method for mechanical protection of the IES grid-interactive port submain is not permitted for the multiple mode IES grid-interactive port."
