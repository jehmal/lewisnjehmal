  "title": "OVERCURRENT PROTECTION",
  "fullText": "Where the energy source is a PV array, AS/NZS 5033 shall be used to determine if overcurrent protection is required and at which locations.\n\nAll other energy source cabling shall be protected against overcurrent in accordance with AS/NZS 3000.\n\nNOTE: Overcurrent protection of the cable needs to take into account fault currents that may be sourced from the inverter and the energy source output.\n\nDevices for protection against overcurrent shall not be provided for circuits where unexpected opening of the circuit could cause a danger greater than overcurrent.\n\nNOTE: Some generation sources, such as some wind turbines, require the output to be short circuited to provide braking for safety reasons. In this situation, the overcurrent device may be omitted.\n\nWhere the energy system incorporates a battery storage system, overcurrent protection shall be provided to protect, as far as practicable, all wiring from prospective short circuit current or overload current from the battery storage system.\n\nNOTE: Overcurrent protection may be by high rupturing capacity (HRC) fuses or circuit breakers suitable for operation on d.c., sized to limit the current below the maximum current-carrying capacity of any part of the connected circuit. The wiring from the battery terminals to the overload protection device should be as short as possible, with special attention paid to its mechanical protection."
