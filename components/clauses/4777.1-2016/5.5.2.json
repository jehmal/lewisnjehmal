  "fullText": "An IES comprised of a single inverter or group of inverters with total capacity of no more than 5 kVA per phase may be isolated by a single isolator adjacent to the group of inverters to meet the requirements for an isolating switch adjacent to the inverter of Clause 3.4.3.\n\nWhere the inverter or group of inverters are connected via terminals on each of the inverter(s), the isolator shall be a labelled isolating switch.\n\nFor a single inverter or group of inverters comprised of pluggable equipment type B and connected by a flexible cable, an installation coupler may be used as an isolation point as an alternative for the adjacent isolation switch. This does not apply to multiple mode inverters.\n\nWhen an installation coupler is used it shall beâ€”\n(a) shrouded, touch-safe and suitable for the environment;\n(b) at the point of transition from inverter interconnect cable to the fixed installation wiring;\n(c) adjacent to the location of the inverter or group of inverters; and\n(d) labelled as to its purpose and include a warning if it is not suitable to break the rated current of the inverter or group of inverters.\n\nThe cabling from the inverter's a.c. isolator to the connected inverters shall be protected against overcurrent (refer to Clause 3.4.2).\n\nNOTE: This allows use of a single isolator and overcurrent protection for a group of inverters. Refer to the manufacturer's installation instructions.\n\nWhere there are multiple groups of inverters that are not adjacent, then multiple isolators shall be used.\n\nNOTE: This allows for the typical installation practices used for micro-inverters (a type of inverter) which are defined in AS/NZS 5033."
