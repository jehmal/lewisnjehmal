  "title": "CONNECTOR OR COUPLING CONNECTIONS TO THE IES",
  "fullText": "Where connection to the inverter is by a flexible cable and connector or coupling device, the cable shall be secured in such a way as to prevent inadvertent disconnection or mechanical stresses on electrical connections. In any such instance, no greater than 300 mm of flexible cable shall be unsupported, with cables managed in such a way as to present no potential for being inadvertently placed under mechanical strain. The flexible cable shall be provided with strain relief by a cable gland or clamping mechanism at each end of the flexible cable.\n\nThe flexible cable shall be chosen to be appropriate for the connector or coupling device to which it will be attached.\n\nWhere inverters have connectors or couplers for their port connections, only pluggable equipment type B shall be used. The inverter connector type shall not be modified. Only connectors and couplers of the make, type and model specified by the equipment manufacturer shall be used. Any connector or coupling device used shall ensure that there are no accessible live parts under any conditions.\n\nPlug and socket connections (as defined in AS/NZS 3112 and AS/NZS 60320.1) or pins for direct insertion into a socket-outlet shall not be used.\n\nNOTE: The plug and socket connections defined in AS/NZS 3112 and AS/NZS 60320.1 are typical three and two pin plugs and socket connections for typical electrical installations and equipment."
