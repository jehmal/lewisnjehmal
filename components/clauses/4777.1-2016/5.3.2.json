  "fullText": "Electrical equipment, components and connections where the presence of water or high humidity presents an increased risk shall be selected and installed toâ€”\n(a) operate safely near or within a damp or wet environment;\n(b) provide additional protection against electric shock; and\n(c) provide adequate protection against damage that might reasonably be expected from the presence of water, high humidity or solar radiation (direct sunlight).\n\nWiring systems or enclosures shall be selected and installed so that the entry of water is prevented and does not cause damage.\n\nWhere water may collect or condensation may form in a wiring system, to the extent that it creates a hazard, provision shall be made for its harmless escape through suitably located drainage points in a way that does not compromise the IP rating of the enclosure.\n\nNOTE: Damp situations and exposure to the environment are considered to be outdoors and unprotected."
