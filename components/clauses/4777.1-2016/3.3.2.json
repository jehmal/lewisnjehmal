  "fullText": "Cables shall be supported so they do not suffer fatigue due to wind/snow effects.\n\nCables shall not lie on roofs or floors without an enclosure or conduit. Cable enclosures and conduits on roofs or floors shall not obstruct the natural water drain paths or promote accumulation of debris.\n\nParticular attention shall be given to the mechanical protection requirements specified in AS/NZS 3000 to maintain the integrity of the cable insulation and conductors.\n\nCables shall be protected from abrasion, tension, compression and cutting forces that may arise from thermal cycles, wind and other forces during installation and throughout the service life of the IES.\n\nAll conduit and ducting exposed to sunlight shall be of a UV resistant type (refer to AS/NZS 2053.1 or AS/NZS 61386.1).\n\nThe method of cable support and fixing shall have a lifetime greater than or equal to the service life of the IES.\n\nNOTES:\n1 Typically plastic cable ties exposed to UV will degrade within 2 to 5 years.\n2 Conduits able to be used in direct sunlight are marked with the letter 'T'."
