  "fullText": "Where connection to the inverter is by a flexible cable and connector or coupling device, these cables shall be secured in such a way as to prevent inadvertent disconnection or mechanical stresses on electrical connections. In any such instance, no greater than 300 mm of flexible cable shall be unsupported, with cables managed in such a way as to present no potential for being inadvertently placed under mechanical strain or subject to mechanical damage. The flexible cable shall be provided with strain relief by a cable gland or clamping mechanism at each end of the flexible cable.\n\nThe flexible cable shall be chosen to be appropriate for the connector or coupling device to which it will be attached.\n\nWhere the inverter's port connections meet the requirements of pluggable equipment type B then only connectors or couplers suitable for pluggable equipment type B shall be used. The inverter connector type shall not be modified. Connectors or couplers shall only be those of the same make, type and model as specified by the inverter manufacturer in the manufacturer's instructions or as labelled on the inverter.\n\nWhere the inverter energy source is from a PV array, the connectors used shall be of the make, type and model specified by the inverter manufacturer and shall comply with the requirements of AS/NZS 5033.\n\nConnectors and couplers used in the IES shall allow safe interconnection between energy sources and inverters. Any connectors or coupling device shall ensure that there are no accessible live parts under any conditions.\n\nNOTE: When an International Standard is published to allow safe interconnection of different brands of connectors and coupling devices, it is intended that this Clause will be amended appropriately."
