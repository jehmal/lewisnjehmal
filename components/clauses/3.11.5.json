  "fullText": "All underground wiring systems shall be spaced not less than 100 mm from other underground services.\nWiring systems shall be suitably marked with warning tape in accordance with Clause 3.11.4.5 and maintain a separation from telecommunications, gas and water services in accordance with Table 3.7.\nFurther requirements for the separation of telecommunications, gas and water systems from low voltage wiring systems are provided in Clause 3.9.8.4.\nNOTES:\n1 Authorities, such as water and gas suppliers and electricity distributors, may require their services to be spaced at a greater distance from underground wiring systems. Also see Figure 3.10.\n2 DN = internal diameter of pipe.\nExceptions:\n1 Two or more underground wiring systems may be grouped together where they are associated with the same electrical installation.\n2 The requirements of this Clause (Clause 3.11.5) may be varied where a number of services are installed touching in a common trench, provided that each service is installed in a separate enclosure that identifies the service.\n3 Separation distances between conductive enclosures and the earthing electrode are not required where all conductive enclosures are bonded within the installation.",
