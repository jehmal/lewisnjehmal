{"section": "8.3.6.2", "title": "Method", "content": {"title": "Method", "fullText": "The integrity of the insulation is stressed by applying a direct current at 500 V for low voltage circuits. Exceptions: 1. Where equipment is likely to be damaged by the test: Such equipment may be disconnected or switched off before testing, or the test voltage may be reduced to 250 V d.c. 2. Where connected equipment is likely to influence the verification test, the equipment may be disconnected before testing and tested separately. The insulation resistance tester used shall maintain its terminal voltage within +20% and -10% of the nominal open circuit terminal voltage, when measuring a resistance of 1 MΩ on the 500 V range or 10 MΩ on the 1000 V range."}}
