        "fullText": "Insulation resistance testing shall be carried out to ensure that the insulation resistance between all live conductors and earth or, as the case may be, all live parts and earth, is adequate to ensure the integrity of the insulation. This testing is to prevent:\n(a) Electric shock hazards from inadvertent contact;\n(b) Fire hazards from short-circuits; and\n(c) Equipment damage.\nIn addition, an insulation resistance test between conductors is necessary for consumer mains and submains to minimize the risk of injury or property damage because of insulation breakdown."
