  "title": "Segregation",
  "fullText": "Where conductors for different electrical installations, or for individual occupancies forming part of single or multiple electrical installations are installed in a common enclosure, they shall be effectively segregated from each other within that enclosure.\nEffective segregation may be achieved by the use of independently sheathed cables, barriers of fire-resisting material or by distance (minimum 50 mm).\nException: This requirement need not apply to switchboards at which such circuits originate or terminate."
