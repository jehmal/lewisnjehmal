  "title": "Common neutral",
  "fullText": "Each single-phase circuit, and each multiphase circuit that requires a neutral conductor for the operation of connected equipment, shall incorporate a neutral conductor.\nA common neutral conductor may be used for two or more circuits originating from the same supply subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\tThe continuity of the common neutral conductor shall not depend on connections at the terminals of electrical equipment, including control switches.\n(b)\tFinal subcircuits that contain a common neutral shall be controlled and protected by linked circuit-breakers or linked switches.\n(c)\tThe neutral conductor shall be marked at switchboards to identify the associated active conductors in accordance with Clause 2.10.5.5.\n(d)\tAlternative sources of supply to a single appliance (such as a water heater, space heater or airconditioner) shall have a common isolating switch.\nNOTES:\n1\tTypical applications for common neutrals include groups of single-phase lights arranged across multiphase supply, and separate components of a single-phase appliance, such as a cooking unit.\n2\tLooping of a common neutral conductor at terminals of equipment supplied from different circuits may cause the load side neutral conductor potential to rise to full line voltage and create a dangerous live situation when disconnected for repair or replacement of the equipment.\n3\tThis Clause does not preclude connection of a common neutral in a junction box.\nThe current-carrying capacity of a common neutral shall be determined from the current-carrying capacity of the associated active conductors in accordance with Clause 3.5.2."
