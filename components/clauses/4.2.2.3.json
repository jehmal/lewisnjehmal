  "fullText": "(a) High surface temperature Where fixed electrical equipment could attain surface temperatures that would cause a fire hazard to adjacent materials, the electrical equipment shall be—\n(i) mounted on or within materials that will withstand such temperatures and are of low thermal conductance;\n(ii) screened from combustible building elements by materials that will withstand such temperatures and are of low thermal conductance; or\n(iii) mounted at a sufficient distance from any material on which such temperatures could have deleterious thermal effects, any means of support being of low thermal conductance so as to allow safe dissipation of heat.\n(b) High radiant temperature Fixed electrical equipment causing a focusing or concentration of heat shall be placed at a sufficient distance from any fixed object or building element so that the object or element, in normal conditions, cannot be subjected to a dangerous temperature.\nNOTES:\n1 Some building materials can be affected by pyrolysis—the decomposition of organic material as a result of long-term exposure to elevated temperatures. Where exposed to high temperatures for a significant period of time such materials can degenerate and self-ignite.\n2 Tungsten filament lamps, ELV halogen lamps, radiant heaters, infra-red lamps, ballasts and transformers are examples of high temperature sources.\n3 Restriction of heat dissipation from electrical equipment, e.g. by thermal insulation, can result in high temperatures in the electrical equipment itself."
