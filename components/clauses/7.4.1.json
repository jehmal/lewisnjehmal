        "fullText": "The particular requirements of this Clause (Clause 7.4) provide methods of protection against electric shock arising from indirect contact that are deemed to comply with Clause 1.5.5.5. These methods include that of protection by electrical separation of the supply. Protection by electrical separation is an alternative to other recognized methods and is intended, in an individual circuit, to prevent shock current through contact with exposed conductive parts that might be energized by a fault in the basic insulation of that circuit. Protection by electrical separation shall be afforded by compliance with Clauses 7.4.2 to 7.4.4, and with: (a) Clause 7.4.5 for a supply to one item of equipment; or (b) Clause 7.4.6 for a supply to more than one item of equipment. NOTE: Figure 7.6 provides an illustration of a separated supply to single and multiple items of equipment.",
