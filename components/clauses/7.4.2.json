        "fullText": "The source supplying a separated circuit shall be: (a) An isolating transformer complying with AS/NZS 61558 so that the output is separated from the input by double insulation or equivalent. NOTE: The scope of AS/NZS 61558.1 incorporates isolating transformer ratings up to 25 kVA for single-phase and 40 kVA for multiphase. The use of higher ratings is permitted provided that the relevant construction and verification provisions of AS/NZS 61558 are applied. (b) A generator output, e.g., a motor-generator set that is installed so that the output is separated from the frame of the generator. NOTE: The fitting of an RCD and the connection of an equipotential bonding conductor and an additional conductor to the generator output winding to ensure the correct operation of the RCD, does NOT provide the output separation required by this Clause. See AS/NZS 3010 for details. (c) An isolated inverter complying with the safety requirements of AS/NZS 4763. NOTE: The rated output for separated (isolated) transformers or generators should be limited to 25 kVA for single-phase and 40 kVA for poly-phase supplies to ensure stable operation.",
