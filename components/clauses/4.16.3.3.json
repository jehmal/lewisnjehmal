  "fullText": "A capacitor not connected in parallel with an individual appliance shall comply with the following requirements:\n(a)\tThe capacitor shall be controlled by a circuit-breaker fitted with an overcurrent release.\nProvision shall be made for the discharge of the capacitor by the use of—\n(i)\tauxiliary contacts of the circuit-breaker that automatically connect a discharge device to the capacitor immediately when it is disconnected from the supply; or\n(ii)\ta permanently connected discharge device in parallel with the capacitor.\nException: Where either—\n(a)\tthe capacitor is rated at not more than 100 kVAr (reactive power); or\n(b)\teach capacitor in a bank of shunt-connected capacitors is rated at not more than 100 kVAr (reactive power),\nthe capacitor may be controlled by a quick make-and-break switch or contactor and protected by fuses, provided that the following requirements are met:\n(A)\tSuch switching shall incorporate a means of manual operation to provide for the individual isolation of each capacitor, or for the capacitor bank as a whole.\n(B)\tProvision shall be made for the discharge of the capacitor by the use of a permanently connected discharge device in parallel with the capacitor.\n(b)\tNo fuse or switch shall be connected between—\n(i)\tthe auxiliary contacts of the circuit-breaker and the discharge device referred to in Item (a)(i); or\n(ii)\tthe permanently connected discharge device and a capacitor referred to in Item (a)(ii)."
