A 'shock current' is an electric current of sufficient magnitude and duration to cause an electric shock. AS/NZS 60479 provides further information on the effects of shock current through the human body.\n2. Protection under normal conditions, designated as 'basic protection' (direct contact), is defined in Clause 1.4.97.\n3. Protection under fault conditions, designated as 'fault protection' (indirect contact), is defined in Clause 1.4.98.\n• (b) Excessive temperatures: Excessive temperatures likely to cause burns, fires, and other damaging effects.\nPersons, fixed equipment, and fixed materials adjacent to electrical equipment shall be protected against harmful effects of heat developed by electrical equipment, or thermal radiation, particularly the following effects:\no (i) Combustion or degradation of materials.\no (ii) Risk of burns.\no (iii) Impairment of the safe function of installed equipment.\n• (c) Explosive atmospheres: Equipment installed in areas where explosive gases or dusts may be present shall provide protection against the ignition of such gases or dusts."
