  "fullText": "The operating characteristics of a device protecting a conductor against overload shall satisfy the following two conditions:\nIB  IN  IZ\t. . . 2.1\nI2  1.45  IZ\t. . . 2.2\nwhere\nIB\t= the current for which the circuit is designed, e.g. maximum demand\nIN\t= the nominal current of the protective device\nIZ\t= the\tcontinuous\tcurrent-carrying\tcapacity\tof\tthe\tconductor (see the AS/NZS 3008.1 series)\nI2\t= the current ensuring effective operation of the protective device and may be taken as equal to either—\n(a)\tthe\toperating\tcurrent\tin\tconventional\ttime\tfor\tcircuit- breakers (1.45 IN); or\n(b)\tthe fusing current in conventional time for fuses (1.6 IN for fuses in accordance with the IEC 60269 series).\nNOTES:\n1\tTo satisfy Equation 2.2, the nominal current IN of a fuse should not exceed 90% of IZ (1.45/1.6 = 0.9), therefore—\nfor circuit-breakers\tEquation 2.1 applies\nfor HRC fuses\tIB  IN  0.9IZ\t. . . 2.3\n2\tFor adjustable devices, the nominal current IN is the current setting selected.\n3\tProtection in accordance with this Clause will not ensure complete protection in certain cases, e.g. against sustained overcurrent less than IZ, nor will it necessarily result in an economical solution. Therefore, it is assumed that the circuit is so designed that small overloads of long duration will not frequently occur. Such overloads can cause premature ageing of the insulation.\n4\tFor further information, see Paragraph B3.2.1, Appendix B."
