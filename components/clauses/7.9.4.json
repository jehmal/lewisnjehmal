        "fullText": "The final subcircuit shall be protected by a separate residual current device (RCD) of Type B complying with IEC 62423, with a maximum rated residual current of 30 mA which operates in all live (active and neutral) conductors. Combined RCD and overcurrent circuit-breakers (RCBOs) may be used.\nException: For Mode 3 charging facilities, a Type A RCD with a maximum rated residual current of 30 mA, in conjunction with a residual direct current-detecting device (RDC-DD) conforming to IEC 62955 may be used.\nNote: The RDC-DD disconnects supply where residual d.c. currents of 6 mA or greater are detected."
