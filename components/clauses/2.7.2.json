  "title": "Protection by Insulation or Separation",
  "fullText": "Measures to prevent danger because of faults between live parts of the electrical installation and circuits supplied at higher voltages shall consist of the following:\n(a) For conductors, the provision of adequate insulation screening or segregation of circuits in accordance with Clause 3.9.8.3.\n(b) For transformers, the provision of adequate insulation, screening or separation of windings. Transformer windings that operate at different voltages shall be insulated from one another by insulation with a specified test voltage or alternatively separated from one another by means of a conductive screen connected to the protective earthing conductor so as to ensure automatic disconnection of the supply in the event of a fault."
