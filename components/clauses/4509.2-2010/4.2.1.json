    "fullText": "The photovoltaic array should be located where it will be unshaded for at least 4 h before and after solar noon (the time when the sun is highest in the sky), during all seasons. Where appropriate, vegetation causing significant shading should be removed. Where this is not possible or desirable, allowance should be made for reduced irradiation in array output calculations. (See Clause 3.4.3.)\nIn d.c. coupled systems, consideration shall also be given to minimizing the length of cable run to the battery."
