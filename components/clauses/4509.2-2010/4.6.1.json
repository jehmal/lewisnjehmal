    "fullText": "The battery installation shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of AS/NZS 4509.1 and the batteries should be located in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.\nConsideration should also be given to the following:\n(a)\tLocalized heat sources should not be present e.g. direct sunlight, generators, battery proximity to walls exposed to direct sunlight.\n(b)\tExtreme ambient temperatures should be avoided because low temperatures decrease battery capacity and high temperatures shorten battery life.\n(c)\tThe battery bank location should preclude contamination of the natural environment, damage to equipment and injury to personnel in the event of electrolyte spillage.\n(d)\tThe battery bank should not be located near combustible material or near metal objects capable of falling across the battery terminals and causing a short-circuit.\n(e)\tThe size of the enclosure should allow for sufficient clearance to provide access for installation, maintenance, handling equipment and safety equipment.\n(f)\tIn New Zealand, the battery enclosure or stand shall protect the batteries from damage due to seismic (earthquake) activity and it shall comply with NZS 4219.\n(g)\tIn Australia, the battery stand or supports shall comply with AS 1170.4.\n(h)\tThe supporting surface of the enclosure should have adequate structural strength to support the battery bank weight and its support structure.\n(i)\tThe enclosure should be resistant to the effects of electrolyte, either by the selection of materials used or by appropriate coatings. Provision should be made for the containment of any spilled electrolyte. Acid resistant trays in which the batteries sit should be capable of holding electrolyte equal to the capacity of at least one cell of the battery bank.\n(j)\tAny enclosure doors should allow unobstructed exit."
