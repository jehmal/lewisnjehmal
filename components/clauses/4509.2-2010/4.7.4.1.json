    "fullText": "Generating set produce noise covering a wide range of frequencies, with low frequencies predominating. Sound is emitted from two sourcesâ€”the engine body, and the exhaust pipe outlet.\nExhaust noise can be reduced by the following means:\n(a)\tUsing a muffler of adequate noise reduction grade.\n(b)\tPointing the exhaust away from any residence.\n(c)\tEnsuring that there is no direct sound path to any residence.\nNoise from the engine body can be reduced by any or all of the following means, as appropriate:\n \n(i)\tLocate the generating set as far as possible from any residence, preferably not upwind of the residence in the prevailing wind direction.\n(ii)\tLocate the generating set so there is no direct sound path from the generating set to any residence (erect a barrier if necessary).\n(iii)\tEnclose the generating set in a soundproof enclosure or room (taking care to ensure adequate cooling air is available to the engine). Heavy construction is preferred, or light construction with sound absorbing lining.\n(iv)\tEnsure proper sealing around doors and other openings.\n(v)\tFor permanent openings in an enclosure (e.g. for cooling air inlet or discharge), incorporate some form of attenuation (e.g. cowl or louvre, preferably acoustically lined, or air attenuator/silencer).\n(vi)\tUse a generating set with integral noise reducing enclosure.\nNOTES:\n1\tConfining generating set run times to daytime only will reduce the level of noise attenuation required.\n2\tNoise levels are dependent on fuel type, engine operating speed and load. Fuel types, in order of increasing noise levels, are gas, petrol, diesel."
