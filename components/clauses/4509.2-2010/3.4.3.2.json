    "fullText": "Where appropriate measured data is not available, calculations of the daily energy output of photovoltaic modules should be based on manufacturer's specifications (including tolerances) and daily average irradiation on the inclined plane with derating for daily average cell temperature and module operating voltage. Allowance for soiling may also be made where this is deemed to be appropriate.\nNOTE: Appendix A contains a worked example."
