    "fullText": "Noise produced by inverters or electronic equipment is generally of mid to high frequencies. Noise levels may be of concern where equipment is located within a residence. In such a case, the equipment may be housed in an enclosure of adequate construction to attenuate noise to the required level. In small enclosures, care should be taken to ensure the equipment will have an adequate flow of cooling air."
