    "fullText": "This Standard sets out requirements and guidance for the design of stand-alone power systems with energy storage at extra-low voltage used for the supply of extra-low and low voltage electric power in a domestic situation. Equipment up to the system output terminals is covered.\nThe principles in this Standard are equally applicable to other systems including commercial and industrial applications and should be considered in the design of those systems.\nOptimization of system design considering time of energy use is not covered by this Standard.\nNOTE: A bibliography containing references to additional material is in Appendix G."
