    "fullText": "Long-term data (over many years) from a nearby site should be used with care and must be adjusted according to differences between the measurement site and the installation site in terms of the effect of major geographical features, local terrain, exposure and the height of interest. Ideally, short-term measurements at the proposed installation site should be correlated with long-term data from the nearby site, to obtain a more accurate estimate of long-term wind speeds. Consideration should be given to the shading from growth of trees and possible future development of other buildings around the site.\nAccurate assessment of the wind resource requires the application of expert knowledge and judgement and is beyond the scope of this Standard."
