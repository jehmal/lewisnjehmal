    "fullText": "Performance specifications should be based on the equations and other considerations outlined in Sections 2, 3 and 4.\nMajor system parameters which should be specified (for annual, seasonal or monthly periods, as appropriate to the basis of the design) areâ€”\n(a)\tdesign d.c. load energy and design a.c. load energy;\n(b)\tload management strategies or conditions necessary for performance as specified;\n(c)\tmaximum and surge demand;\n(d)\taverage daily energy output of each renewable energy generator under design conditions;\n(e)\texpected contribution to the load from each generator under design conditions, as a percentage;\n(f)\tnominal generating set run time under design conditions;\n(g)\trenewable energy resource data used for design calculations including adjustments for site conditions and design parameters (e.g. PV array tilt angle and orientation, wind turbine tower height);\n(h)\tsystem voltage; and\n(i)\tratings of major components."
