    "fullText": "Other measures include the use of washing machines, dishwashers and other household appliances with a low energy consumption. The energy efficiency rating for the appliance (e.g. the kWh figures given on the Energy Star Rating label on the appliance) may be a useful guide. Washing machines, dishwashers and other devices that have built in heating elements are more likely to have a lower energy efficiency rating."
