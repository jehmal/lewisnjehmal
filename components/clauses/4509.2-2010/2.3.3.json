    "fullText": "Energy sources for these services should be chosen on the basis ofâ€”\n(a)\tavailability of energy sources and conversion technology;\n(b)\tan appropriate match between the energy source and the service and the efficiency of conversion (e.g. use gas for heating rather than electricity);\n(c)\tcost;\n(d)\tuser preference; and\n(e)\treliability.\nServices deemed to be most appropriately supplied with electrical energy will form the load for the stand-alone power system.\nThe most important outcome of this approach is that heating services such as hot water, cooking and space heating generally are best supplied by sources that provide heat directly, rather than through conversion from electricity.\nWhen excess renewable energy is available, consideration should be given to utilizing it for opportunity loads (e.g. for water heating or water pumping)."
