    "fullText": "Generating sets producing a.c. are commonly connected into the system in one of three ways, as set out in Clauses 3.3.4.2 to 3.3.4.4. The 'series configuration' and the 'switched configuration' are only applicable to d.c. bus systems. The 'parallel configuration' is applicable to both a.c. and d.c. bus systems. In the case of a.c. bus generator connections refer to Figure 1B."
