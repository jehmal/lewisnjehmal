    "fullText": "The following factors should be considered in the selection of inverters:\n(a)\tMaximum and surge demand and their match to the inverter's ratings at expected maximum ambient temperature. If a high demand condition is likely to persist for an extended period, allowance should be made for this when applying maximum demand calculations to inverter sizing.\n(b)\tAccount for load growth or uncertainty.\n(c)\tWaveform quality (harmonic distortion compared to a pure sine wave).\n(d)\tPower efficiency.\n(e)\tEarthing arrangements.\n(f)\tNo-load and stand-by power consumption.\n(g)\tD.C. operating voltage range.\n(h)\tVoltage and frequency regulation.\n(i)\tPower factor handling range.\n(j)\tPerformance with 'problem loads' (e.g. half wave loads or other loads which draw large harmonic currents).\n(k)\tElectromagnetic interference (C-tick).\n(l)\tSystem configuration.\n(m)\tSoft start capability.\n(n)\tControl of operating parameters.\n(o)\tProtection (thermal, electrical).\n(p)\tLoad profile.\n(q)\tInverter isolation and bonding.\n(r)\tPower rating at expected high ambient temperatures\n(s)\tIngress Protection (IP) rating\n(t)\tVentilation requirements\nFor general domestic use, sinewave inverters with electromagnetic interference levels within the limits specified by AS/NZS 1044 are recommended.\nInverter ratings are limited by heat dissipation within the equipment, which is a function of the output current. Sizing should therefore be based on apparent power (volt-amperes), rather than real power. Where apparent power is not known for each load, it may be estimated from the real power consumption divided by an assumed power factor of 0.8."
