    "fullText": "Systems which rely entirely on renewable energy sources will be heavily affected by the variation in output from these sources. The sizing of both energy storage (see Clause 3.4.7) and renewable energy generators should therefore be greater than that required for systems incorporating a generating set. Consideration should be given to the degree of resource variability, and to the length of time over which poor resource availability is likely to persist. Generators should be sized to allow full recharge of the batteries from maximum depth of discharge in an acceptable time-frame, e.g. 14 days, as well as the capacity to provide an equalizing charge.\nWhere annual, monthly or worst month resource data is used for renewable energy generator sizing, an 'oversupply co-efficient', fo, may be used in the design process to allow for the increase in size required. For the purposes of generator sizing, the design load should be first multiplied by the oversupply co-efficient. Typical values for fo are given in Table 1. The appropriate value should be determined on the basis of the considerations mentioned above, as well as the nature of the load. Critical loads require a higher value of fo than non-critical loads. Systems designed on the basis of annual resource data should use values of fo at the higher end of the range given in Table 1.\nParticular care should be taken with wind-only systems because of the great variability of the resource. Wind-only systems are generally not viable if wind droughts longer than a week or two occur (because of the cost of energy storage)."
