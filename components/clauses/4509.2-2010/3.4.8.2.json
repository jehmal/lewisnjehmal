    "fullText": "Regulators for photovoltaic arrays should be capable of carrying 125% of the array short- circuit current. Regulators shall withstand the open circuit voltage of the array at the lowest expected operating temperature.\nLarge arrays may need to be split into sub-arrays. Considerations areâ€”\n(a)\tthe availability of high current regulators;\n(b)\timproved fault tolerance; and\n(c)\tmore staged battery charging."
