    "fullText": "Records of wind speed are kept by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the New Zealand Meteorological Service, NZ NIWA (National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research), some agricultural research stations and mining operations. Reports from special purpose wind surveys may also be available from State or Federal energy authorities. Care should be taken with the use of surface wind analysis reports containing data from 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. only, as average daily wind speeds may be affected by diurnal variations not shown in this data. Where possible, the complete records (all hours) should be obtained.\nIsovent maps may provide a very rough indication of the wind resource in the absence of more detailed measurements."
