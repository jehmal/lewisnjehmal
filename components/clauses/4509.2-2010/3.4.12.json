    "fullText": "Cables shall be sized to satisfy both their voltage drop requirement and their current carrying capacity limitation. Extra-low voltage (ELV) wiring is normally sized to limit the voltage drop, except in the case of high current, short cable runs. Battery bank to inverter cabling is the most common exception, where the current carrying capacity of the cable is normally the limiting factor.\nWhere parallel battery strings are used, cabling should be arranged so the current paths through each string are of equal length and equal cross-sectional area (i.e. between common connection points). This is to ensure the voltage drop is the same for each string.\nSee Table 5 for recommended maximum voltage drop losses.\nNOTE: Appendix C gives a worked example of a cable sizing calculation and Appendix D gives an example of circuit protection sizing.\n\nTABLE  5\nRECOMMENDED MAXIMUM VOLTAGE DROP\n\nd.c.voltage drops\nPhotovoltaic\tLess than 5%\nWind and micro-hydro generators:\tLess than 10% at rated output\nBattery bank to d.c.loads\tLess than 5%\nNOTES:\n1\tVoltage drop requirements for ELV circuits in AS/NZS 3000 should not be used\n2\tFor some situations overall cost effectiveness will lead to larger voltage drops.\t\na.c.voltage drops\nNOTE: For a.c. bus systems manufacturer's recommendations should be followed regarding voltage drops between system sources"
