    "fullText": "All battery installations, for both vented and valve regulated (sealed) batteries, shall have natural ventilation or be force-ventilated.\n \nNOTES:\n1\tAlthough valve regulated (gel and absorptive glass mat) cells use internal oxygen- recombination to suppress most hydrogen gas evolution, under conditions of overcharge significant amounts of hydrogen gas can be emitted, constituting a hazard.\n2\tSee AS 4086.2 for the calculation of exhaust ventilation rate, method of ventilation and sizing of ventilation apertures."
