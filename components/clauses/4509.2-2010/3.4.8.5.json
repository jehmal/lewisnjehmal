    "fullText": "Battery charging methods and voltage regulation settings should be chosen to suit the batteries and the duty cycle they experience. The primary source of information for correct regulator settings should be the battery manufacturer. Guidelines may also be provided by the manufacturer of the regulator or other charging equipment (e.g. inverter or battery charger).\nTypical charging methods, and voltages (based on electrolyte temperature of 20°C) are listed in Table 3.\n\nTABLE  3\nTYPICAL CHARGING METHODS AND REGULATOR SETTINGS\n\n\nBattery type\t\nCharging method\tCell volts\n\t\tFloat V\tVoltage V\tEqualize V\nFlooded lead acid\tAbsorption charge after a period below gassing voltage; then float charge; equalize charge after prolonged low SOC\t2.25 to 2.30\t2.35 to 2.50\t2.50 to 2.60\nSealed (valve regulated) lead acid\tAbsorption change after a period below gassing voltage; then float charge.
