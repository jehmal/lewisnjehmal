    "fullText": "When a PV module is to be operated at its maximum power point, a temperature derating factor shall be applied. For crystalline silicon, this temperature derating factor can be calculated from Equation 3.4.3.9(1) or determined from manufacturer's data. For other technologies, refer to manufacturer's information.\nThe temperature derating factor can be calculated as follows:\nftemp\t=\t1 ± (γ × (Tcell,eff − Tstc))\t3.4.3.9(1)\nwhere\nftemp\t=\ttemperature derating factor, dimensionless\nγ\t=\tpower temperature co-efficient, in reciprocal degree Celsius (typically\n−0.005 for crystalline silicon)\nTcell, eff\t=\taverage daily effective cell temperature, in degrees Celsius\nTstc\t=\tcell temperature at standard test conditions, in degrees Celsius.\n \nThe derated output power of a module can be calculated as follows:\nPmod\t=\tPstc × fman × ftemp × fdirt\t3.4.3.9(2)\nwhere\nPmod\t=\tderated output power of the module, in watts\nPstc\t=\trated output power of the module under standard test conditions, in watts\nftemp\t=\ttemperature derating factor, dimensionless\nfman\t=\tderating factor for manufacturing tolerance, dimensionless\nfdirt\t=\tderating factor for dirt/soiling, dimensionless\nThe average daily energy output of a photovoltaic array can then be calculated as follows:\nEpv\t=\tPmod × Htilt × N\t3.4.3.9(3)\nwhere\nEpv\t=\tdesign daily energy from the photovoltaic array, in watt hours (Wh)\nPmod\t=\tderated power output of a module, in watts (W)\nHtilt\t=\tdaily irradiation on the tilted plane, in peak sun hours\nN\t=  number of modules in the array (an integer), dimensionless"
