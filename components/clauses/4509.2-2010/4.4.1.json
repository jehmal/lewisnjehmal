    "fullText": "In selecting a site for a micro-hydro turbine the following points should be considered: (a) Obtaining the maximum static head. (b) Being within a suitable distance for transmission of electrical power to the dwelling. (c) Accessibility of the site. The likely flood level for the site should be assessed, in order to either locate the turbine above flood level, or, where the turbine-generator will withstand flooding, make provision for adequate protection from floodwaters and flood-borne debris. Any local regulations regarding diversion of water from the watercourse should be met."
