    "fullText": "Batteries should be capable of meeting both the power and energy requirements of the system. In systems where more than 3 days of autonomy is required, the energy storage capacity of the battery is likely to be the limiting factor in determining battery size. In systems where less than 36 h of autonomy is required, the power output capability of the battery may be the limiting factor in determining battery size.\n \nThe major design parameters to be considered in the sizing of batteries are as follows:\n(a)\tNumber of days of autonomy (dependent on energy sources available, system configuration and climatic conditions).\n(b)\tDaily and maximum depth of discharge (DODmax) (to be chosen with consideration of cycle life characteristics).\n(c)\tDaily energy demand from the d.c. bus.\n(d)\tMaximum power demand.\n(e)\tSurge demand.\n(f)\tMaximum charging current.\nAn appropriate discharge rate should be used when selecting or specifying the capacity of batteries. This discharge rate should consider the maximum load and the duration of the load. For example, for a system with where the average load power requirement is low, a suitable discharge rate for the battery may be the 100 h rate. The capacity of the battery at this discharge rate is denoted as C100. However if a significant fraction of the load energy is drawn at a higher rate, it may be necessary to select the battery capacity at a higher discharge rate, e.g. 10 h rate or 20 h rate."
