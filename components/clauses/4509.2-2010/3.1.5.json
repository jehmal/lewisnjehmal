    "fullText": "The seasonal variation in demand will have an influence on the optimum tilt angle for PV arrays, and on the performance of all systems, regardless of the type of generation source. Systems designed to supply a demand of 1 kWh/d or less may be designed without reference to seasonal variations in demand. Design of systems to supply more than 1 kWh/d should take seasonal variations into account, preferably based on data for each month of the year.\nTypical causes of seasonal variation for various energy services are as follows:\n(a)\tSpace heating—heating degree days per month.\n(b)\tSpace cooling—cooling degree days per month.\n(c)\tRefrigeration—ambient temperature.\n(d)\tLighting—night time hours.\n(e)\tCooking—seasonal cooking habits.\n(f)\tCleaning—little variation.\n(g)\tEntertainment—little variation.\n(h)\tKitchen appliances—little variation.\n(i)\tPower tools—little variation, or dependent on seasonal work patterns.\n(j)\tOffice equipment—little variation.\n(k)\tWater pumping—rainfall variation and ambient temperature for irrigation, household activity patterns for domestic supply."
