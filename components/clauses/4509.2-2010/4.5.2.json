    "fullText": "The discharge end of the exhaust pipe should be fitted with some form of weather protection or otherwise arranged so as to prevent entry of rain into the exhaust system and it should not point directly into any area likely to be occupied or used by people (e.g. a window in the residence).\nThe exhaust system should include a muffler to reduce noise emissions to an acceptable level (refer Clause 4.7.4). The back pressure created by the exhaust pipe and muffler should not exceed the specifications for correct operation of the engine."
