    "fullText": "The key feature of this configuration is that the output from the generating set, when running, may supply both the battery charger and the a.c. loads directly (refer to Figure 3). When the generating set is not running, the a.c. loads will be switched to the inverter.\nThe switching may be done automatically, or manually by a changeover switch. In either case, it is essential that the changeover switch or contactor has a break-before-make action. Where a manual changeover switch is used, a switch with a 'centre-OFF' position is recommended. The battery charger, inverter and automatic changeover contactor may be incorporated into a single unit (inverter-charger).\nIf the inverter output is not synchronized before connection, a break in supply long enough to accommodate reverse voltages should be provided.\nNOTE: A break of 20 ms may be adequate for most domestic situations however large inductive loads could require a considerably longer period. AS/NZS 3000 requires that all changeover devices have a voltage rating appropriate for the maximum out of phase voltage between contacts connected to different sources.\nThis configuration provides efficient utilization of the generating set power, but does require that a.c. loads are tolerant of short breaks in supply."
