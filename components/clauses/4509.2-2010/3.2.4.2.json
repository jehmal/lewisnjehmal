    "fullText": "The magnitude of the hydro resource depends on two quantities. These areâ€”\n(a)\tstream flow; and\n(b)\tstatic head.\nStream flow measurements may be made by a variety of methods.\nPreliminary estimates of static head may be based on topographic maps. However, detailed design or performance estimates should be based on on-site measurements."
