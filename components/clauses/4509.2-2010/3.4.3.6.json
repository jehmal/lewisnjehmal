    "fullText": "Allowance should be made for manufacturing tolerances on module output. For example, where tolerance is Â±5% on output current or power, a derating factor of 0.95 should be applied to these quantities.\nFor temperature derating see Clauses 3.4.3.7 to 3.4.3.9.\nTypical derating factors for soiling vary from 1.00 (no derating) to 0.90. The lower figure would apply at sites which are both dusty and where regular cleaning is impractical."
