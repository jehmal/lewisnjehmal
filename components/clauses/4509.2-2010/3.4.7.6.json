    "fullText": "The number of days of autonomy should be determined in consultation with the user. The following factors should be considered:\n(a)\tAcceptable level of loss of load probability\n(b)\tThe intermittency of the renewable energy source.\n(c)\tThe presence of firm (available on demand) generation such as a generating set.\n(d)\tThe average daily depth of discharge as to afford satisfactory battery life.\n(e)\tThe energy source to battery storage ratio as to ensure acceptable re-charge times and regular charge to full cycles to satisfy battery manufacturer's recommendations.\nExamples of typical number of days of autonomy for various applications:\n\nSystem\tAutonomy (d)\tTypical considerations\n100% Hydro\t1.5\tAverage daily depth of discharge\nSystem with automatic generating set control\t2\tReliability of auto start\nSystem with manual generating set control\t2 to 3\tUser\nPV, wind, or hybrid systems without\t4 to 5\tProbability of number of consecutive days of\ngenerating set\t\tlow solar irradiation\n\t\tProbability of number of consecutive days of\n\t\tno wind"
