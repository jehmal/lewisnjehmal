    "fullText": "In cases where local authorities have guidelines or by-laws specifying maximum acceptable noise levels, these should be referred to. Where no such guidelines or by-laws exist, the following factors should be considered:\n(a)\tEquipment noise levels which are less than 5 dB above the background noise level are unlikely to cause annoyance in any circumstances.\n(b)\tIrregular or inconsistent noises are generally more annoying than steady noises.\n(c)\tThe annoyance value of any noise is subjective, and depends on the kind of activities being carried out in the area in question and the listener's expectations."
