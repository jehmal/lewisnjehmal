    "fullText": "Where the panel is to be connected through standard switched regulators (non-maximum power point tracking) the current output should be determined from the manufacturer's I-V curves or other specifications at the daily average cell operating temperature, daily average module operating voltage, and irradiance specified under standard operating conditions. Operating voltage should be determined taking into account the average voltage of the battery during the day, plus all voltage drops between the battery and the PV array. Typically, these will include cable and regulator drops. A typical average daily module operating voltage would be 14 to 14.5 V.\n \nThe derated output current of the module can be calculated as follows:\n\nImod\t=\tIT,V × fman × fdirt\nwhere\nImod    =  derated current output of the module, in amperes\nIT,V\t= output current of the module at the average daily equivalent cell temperature, daily average module operating voltage, and irradiance specified under standard operating conditions, in amperes\nfman\t=  derating factor for manufacturing tolerance, dimensionless\nfdirt\t=  derating factor for dirt/soiling, dimensionless\nThe output of the array may then be calculated in terms of charge (Ah). The average daily charge output of the array can be calculated as follows:\n \n\nwhere\n \nQarray\t=\tImod × Htilt × Np\t3.4.3.8(1)\n\n\nQarray\t=\taverage daily charge output of the array, in ampere hours (Wh)\nImod\t=\tderated current output of a module, in amperes (A)\nHtilt\t=\tdaily irradiation on the tilted plane (i.e. on the plane of the array), in peak sun hours\nNp\t=\tnumber of parallel strings of modules in the array (an integer), dimensionless"
