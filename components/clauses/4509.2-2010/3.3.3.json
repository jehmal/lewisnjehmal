    "fullText": "Where more than one generator is used, their outputs may be connected in common at the a.c. or d.c. bus.\nIn d.c. bus systems the renewable sources are generally connected to the d.c. bus (and battery) via individual regulators as shown in Figure 1A. D.C. loads are then connected to the d.c. bus and a.c. loads are connected to an inverter supplied from the d.c. bus.\nIn a.c bus systems a bi-directional inverter connected to a battery bank establishes an a.c bus. Renewable sources in this configuration are then connected via individual inverters to the a.c. bus. In this case the individual inverters act as the regulators for the renewable source and generally provide maximum power point regulation. Loads are generally supplied from the a.c bus but d.c loads may be supplied via a connection to the d.c. bus (i.e. battery).\nRefer to Figure 1A for renewable energy generators connected at the d.c. bus. Refer to Figure 1B for renewable energy generators connected at the a.c. bus.\nWhen considering the design of any system the path the energy takes in travelling from the source to the load considering the need for intermediate storage for use at times when the resource is not available should be carefully considered. In both a.c. and d.c bus systems the energy paths and the devices through which the energy passes needs to be carefully taken into account in calculating the subsystem efficiencies. Refer to Clause 3.4.2.2."
