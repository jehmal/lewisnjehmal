    "title": "Arrangement of ventilation",
    "fullText": "The following recommendations apply to the arrangement and layout of the ventilation system:\n(a)\tExhaust air should not pass over other electrical devices.\n(b)\tBattery enclosures should be provided with ventilation holes, grilles or vents so that air sweeps across the battery. To avoid stratification of the airflow, it is recommended that ventilation inlets and outlets consist ofâ€”\n(i)\ta number of holes spaced evenly along the enclosure; or\n(ii)\ta slot running along the side of the room or enclosure.\n(c)\tBattery enclosures should be designed to prevent the formation of pockets of gas.\n(d)\tVentilation outlets should be at the highest level of the battery enclosure.\n(e)\tVentilation inlets should be at a low level in the battery enclosure. Inlets should be no higher than the top of the battery cells, and fitted with a coarse screen to prevent the entry of vermin.\n(f)\tTo ensure airflow does not bypass the battery, ventilation inlets and outlets should be located on opposite sides of the enclosure.\nWhere mechanical ventilation is used, the fan shall be positioned on the inlet and below the battery tops and designed to create airflow through the enclosure. An airflow sensor shall be incorporated to initiate an alarm if the ventilation fan fails."
