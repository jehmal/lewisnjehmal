    "fullText": "There are a number of approaches to the design of stand-alone power systems. The approach recommended by this Standard is based on the following underlying principles:\n(a)\tThe system is safe and meets regulatory requirements. Refer to AS/NZS 4509.1 and AS/NZS 3000.\n(b)\tThe system meets the requirements of the user.\n(c)\tThe provision of electrical energy is not considered in isolation, but is treated within the overall context of the provision of energy services.\n(d)\tThe appropriate level of detail in design depends on the complexity and cost of the system.\n(e)\tThe design guidelines laid out in this Standard are aimed at producing a robust design. This design will generally be conservative and may be further optimized to reduce cost to suit more specific conditions on a case by case basis."
