    "fullText": "The magnitude of the wind resource is very site specific, and on-site measurements are essential in many cases. On-site measurements should be carried out using data logging anemometers, for as long as is practically and economically possible. A period of 12 months of measurements should be considered minimum where long-term records from a nearby site are not available. Where the data is to be correlated with long-term data from a nearby site, a period of less than 12 months may be acceptable provided that it is at least long enough to reliably correlate wind speed for each of the major prevailing wind directions throughout the year. Short-term data should be used with great caution.\nThe anemometer should be sited as close as possible to the proposed installation site for the wind turbine, preferably at the proposed hub height of the turbine or at least at a height which will reduce ground effects to an acceptable level. A cleared site with a height of 10 m is typical. The site should be sufficiently clear of obstacles, such as buildings or trees, to ensure turbulence produced by obstacles does not affect the anemometer."
