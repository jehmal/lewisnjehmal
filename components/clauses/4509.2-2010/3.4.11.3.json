    "fullText": "In switched systems, the generating set should be sized to meet the requirements of the battery charger along with the maximum and surge demand during battery charging, plus an additional design margin. The following equations can be used:\nSgen\t=\t(Sbc + Smax,chg) × fgo\t3.4.11.3(1)\n \n\n\n\nwhere\n \n\nSgen\n \n=\t(Sbc + Ssur,chg ) × fgo\nAs\n \n\n. . . 3.4.11.3(2)\n \nSgen     = apparent power rating of the generating sets, in volt amperes\nSbc\t= maximum apparent input power to the battery charger under conditions of maximum output current and typical maximum charge voltage, in volt amperes (VA)\nSmax,chg   = maximum a.c. demand during battery charging, in volt amperes (VA)\nSsur,chg   = a.c. surge demand during battery charging, in volt amperes (VA)\nfgo\t= generating set over-size factor, dimensionless\nAs\t= ratio of instantaneous current to continuous current output of the alternator (the alternator surge ratio)\nNOTES:\n1\tTypical value for the generating set over-size factor is 1.1.\n2\tRefer to manufacturer's data for alternator surge ratio values. Typical value is 2 to 3, however the ability of a generating set to supply a surge also depends on its inertia, as well as governing and voltage regulation. Small generating set may be limited to surges of very short duration by these factors. Where load surges are of longer duration, the alternator surge ratio should be taken as 1. Methods to reduce the magnitude of the surge may be useful in this case."
