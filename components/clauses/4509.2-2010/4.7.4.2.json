    "fullText": "Wind turbines may produce noise from two sources-turbine blades gearboxes. There are few options available to reduce noise levels, due to constraints in the system design and turbine siting. The main considerations when minimizing noise levels are—\n(a)\tchoice of machine; and\n(b)\tlocation of turbine—as far as possible or practicable from the residence, and downwind in the prevailing wind direction from the residence, if possible.\nNOTES:\n1\tBackground noise levels at windy sites will be elevated by the noise of the wind blowing through vegetation and over built structures.\n2\tNZS 6808 gives a method of assessing the noise from wind turbines."
