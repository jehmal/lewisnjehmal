    "fullText": "Several methods for the estimation of stream flow are available, including the area-rainfall method, the flow correlation method, and variations on these two.\nWhere rainfall and hydrological conditions are similar for both the catchment area of the proposed installation site and a nearby site for which records exist, stream flow for the proposed installation site may be estimated to be proportional to the ratio between the catchment areas of the two sites. Where hydrology is similar but rainfall is known to be different, the stream flow may also be adjusted in proportion to the ratio between the rainfall at the two sites.\nWhere possible, flow measurements should be carried out a number of times over at least a one year period at the proposed installation site. These measurements may then be correlated with measurements taken at the recording station at the same time. If a reasonable correlation exists, this correlation may then be extrapolated over all years of records to obtain an estimate of long-term stream flow at the proposed installation site.\nAccurate assessment of the hydro resource requires the application of expert knowledge and judgement and is beyond the scope of this Standard. Information for small watercourses should be used with great caution due to local variations, e.g. microclimate, hydrology."
