    "fullText": "Steps should be taken to ensure noise produced by any of the system components is of an acceptably low level. The components of most concern in this respect areâ€”\n(a)\tgenerating set;\n(b)\twind turbines; and\n(c)\tinverters and other electronic equipment using high frequency power conversion techniques.\nIn critical situations, the advice of a specialist should be sought. Reference should be made to AS 1359.109 for noise limits for rotating machines.\nNOTE: Information  on  the  prediction,  measurement  and  assessment  of  sound  from  both horizontal and vertical wind turbine generators can be obtained from NZS 6808."
