    "title": "Principles of noise attenuation",
    "fullText": "Application of the following principles may be of use in attenuating noise to acceptable levels:\n(a)\tSound levels are reduced by 6 dB for every doubling of distance from the noise source.\n(b)\tGenerally sparse vegetation provides little sound attenuation whereas 10 m depth of thickly wooded forest could provide a reduction of 10 dB.\n(c)\tSolid barriers are most effective. Small openings in walls, around doors and in other barriers allow significant noise to pass through.\n(d)\tSound propagation is affected by wind speed and direction and will be higher in the downwind direction.\n(e)\tLow frequency sound diffracts (bends) around corners more than high frequency sound.\n(f)\tLow frequency sound can be attenuated only by distance, and by the use of massive (i.e. heavy construction) barriers between the source and the listener.\n(g)\tSound may be easily reflected off solid barriers, especially mid and high frequency sound.\n(h)\tThe use of sound absorbing material (e.g. sound batts) as a lining on walls or other barriers may provide benefit in two waysâ€”\n(i)\tby reducing reverberation, especially in enclosures of solid construction such as brick; and\n(ii)\tby reducing transmission of sound through the wall or barrier, especially through walls of lightweight construction."
