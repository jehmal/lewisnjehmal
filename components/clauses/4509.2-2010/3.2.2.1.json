    "fullText": "Various sources of long-term solar radiation data exist. Solar radiation data tables based on long-term pyranometer measurements provide the most reliable source of data, and have the convenience of presenting data for surfaces at various orientations and tilts. However, adjustments may need to be applied for sites some distance away from the measurement station. Satellite based measurements have the advantage of being available for virtually any location, however, the number of years of records may not be as great. Satellite data is usually only available as irradiation on the horizontal plane, and a suitable model must be used to generate data for the orientation and tilt angle of the array.\nMaps showing average annual solar radiation or solar radiation for the worst month may be used for systems providing a design load of less than 1 kWh/d. It should be noted that these maps are prepared for one tilt angle only e.g. horizontal or latitude angle. The use of these maps is not recommended for systems over 1 kWh/d, unless no suitable long-term information for the site is available. The use of sunshine-hour data to estimate irradiation should be used only where reliable correlation with irradiation can be ascertained."
