  "fullText": "Equipotential bonding is intended to minimize the risks associated with the occurrence of voltage differences between exposed conductive parts of electrical equipment and extraneous conductive parts.\n\nSuch voltage differences can arise from a range of sources including the following:\n(a) A fault external to the installation, either on an incoming extraneous conductor (such as a water or gas pipe, etc.) or on the supply neutral and protective earthing system.\n(b) Distribution system load current in the soil passing through a swimming pool.\n(c) Telecommunication system voltages on equipment adjacent to exposed conductive parts.\n(d) Lightning discharges either directly within the installation or affecting the incoming extraneous conductor or the supply mains."
