  "fullText": "Wiring systems shall be selected and installed so as to minimize damage to the cable insulation, sheathing and connections during installation, operation and maintenance.\nMeasures undertaken to minimize damage may include the following:\n(a) Provision of supports, continuous or at appropriate intervals suitable for the mass of the cable.\n(b) Use of suitable fixings for the cable size and type that hold the cable in position without damage.\n(c) Use of suitable connections for the cable size and type that reduce mechanical strain at joints and terminations.\n(d) Attention to minimum bending radius limits of cables.\n(e) Provision of flexibility to accommodate any movement or tension stresses."
