  "fullText": "Control circuits associated with the operation of fire-pump motors shall: (a) be directly connected between the active and neutral conductor of the pump circuit; (b) be arranged so that the active conductor of the control circuit is directly connected to the coil of the operating device within the starter; and (c) not be provided with overload protective devices other than those provided for the pump-motor circuit, in accordance with Clause 7.2.5.6.2. This arrangement requires the installation of a switch in the neutral conductor of the control circuit for a fire pump.",
