  "title": "Protection by placing out of reach",
  "fullText": "The method of protection 'by placing out of reach' shall only be used in installations where access is restricted to:\n• (a) competent persons; or\n• (b) persons under the supervision of competent persons.\nSimultaneously accessible parts at different voltages shall not be within arm's reach.\nNOTES:\n1. Two parts are deemed to be simultaneously accessible if they are not more than 2.5 m apart.\n2. Placing out of arm's reach is intended only to prevent unintentional contact with live parts.\n3. The term 'arm's reach' is defined in Clause 1.4.16 and illustrated in Figure 1.1.\nWhere a normally occupied position is restricted in the horizontal direction by an obstacle, e.g., handrail or mesh screen, affording a degree of protection less than IPXXB or IP2X, arm's reach shall extend from that obstacle.\nIn the vertical direction, arm's reach shall extend from the surface not taking into account any intermediate obstacle providing a degree of protection less than IPXXB or IP2X.\nIn places where bulky or long conductive objects are normally handled, the distances required by this clause shall be increased to accommodate the relevant dimensions of those objects."
