  "fullText": "Earth electrodes shall be installed in a location that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n• (a) The electrode maintains effective contact with moist soil that is not subject to excessive drying out.\n\nNote: This condition is deemed to be satisfied by locating the electrode:\n• (a) external to the building in ground that is exposed to the weather; or\n• (b) in other locations where the ground remains moist because of soil conditions or covers that reduce loss of moisture.\n\n• (b) The electrode is separated from conductive enclosures of other buried services, such as water, gas, telecommunications, and flammable liquid, in order to reduce possible electrolytic action affecting the electrode or the other service.\n\nNote: Separation distances are specified in Table 3.7.\n\n• (c) The main earthing conductor connection to an electrode is accessible, in accordance with Clause 5.5.1.2.\n\nThe location of the earth electrode shall be identified at the main switchboard.",
