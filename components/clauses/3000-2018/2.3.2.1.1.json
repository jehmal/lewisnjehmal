  "fullText": "Every circuit shall be capable of being isolated from each of the supply conductors, in accordance with Clause 2.3.2.1.2 or 2.3.2.1.3, as appropriate.\nProvided that the service conditions allow it, and the appropriate safety measures are maintained, a group of circuits may be isolated by a common switch.\nProvision shall be made to enable isolation of electrical equipment and to prevent electrical equipment from being inadvertently energized. The means of isolation shall be such that a deliberate action in addition to the normal method of operation is required to energize the circuit.\nNOTE: Such precautions may include one or more of the following measures:\n(a)\tProvision for the fitting of a padlock.\n(b)\tWarning tags or notices.\n(c)\tLocation within a lockable space or enclosure.\n(d)\tShort-circuiting and earthing may be used as a supplementary measure only.\nWhere an item of equipment or enclosure contains live parts connected to more than one supply, a notice shall be placed in such a position that any person gaining access to live parts will be warned of the need to isolate those parts from the various supplies.\nException: A notice need not be provided where an interlocking arrangement is provided or the live parts are suitably shrouded to ensure that all the circuits concerned are isolated.\nWhere relevant, suitable means shall be provided for the discharge of stored electrical energy (see Clause 4.15.3)."
