  "title": "CABLES WITH NON-FERROUS METAL SHEATHING",
  "fullText": "Single-core cables enclosed in lead, copper, aluminium or other non-ferrous metal sheathing shall be used for alternating currents only where one of the following arrangements is employed:\n(a)\tTrefoil formation:\n(i)\tThe cables shall be run in trefoil formation throughout their entire length.\nException: A distance not exceeding two metres at each end to facilitate termination of the cables is permitted.\n(ii)\tThe sheaths of the cables shall be bonded at the point where the trefoil formation ceases, or at the switchboard termination, and the conductivity of the bonding conductor shall be not less than that of the cable sheath.\n(b)\tOther than trefoil formation:\n(i)\tThe cables shall be placed as near as practicable to each other (they may be touching).\n(ii)\tThe sheathing of the cables shall be bonded at both ends and at intervals not exceeding 30 m along the cable run. The conductivity of the bonding conductor shall be not less than that of the cable sheath.\nException: Where the sheathing of cables is provided by a serving, the bonding need only be carried out at both ends."
