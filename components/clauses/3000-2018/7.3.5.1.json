  "title": "Electricity Generation System Protection",
  "fullText": "Electricity generation systems shall be provided with overcurrent protection, in line with the applicable Australian, New Zealand, or Australian/New Zealand Standard for the particular generating system. Where the relevant Standard does not specify overcurrent requirements, then the following requirements apply:\n(a) Overcurrent protective devices shall be located as close as practicable to the output terminals of the electricity generation system so that the unprotected interconnecting conductors to an electrical installation are as short as practicable and, in no case, exceed 15 m in length.\nException: Overcurrent protective devices need not be provided where the unexpected interruption of the supply could cause a greater danger than overcurrent.\n(b) Any unprotected interconnecting conductors between the generating set and associated switchboard shall be completely enclosed by metal or other material that is not combustible or installed underground.\nException: Overcurrent protection may be provided by:\n1.\tan overcurrent protective device within the electricity generation system; or\n2.\tthe characteristics of the electricity generation system being unable to support the fault current.\nWhere a single electricity generation system is intended to operate in parallel with another electricity generation system, circulating harmonic currents shall be limited so that the current carrying capacity of conductors is not exceeded.\nNOTE: The effects of circulating harmonic currents may be limited as follows:\n(a) The selection of generating sets with compensated windings.\n(b) The provision of a suitable impedance in the connection to generator star points.\n(c) The provision of switches that interrupt the circulatory circuit but that are interlocked so that at all times fault protection is not impaired.\n(d) The provision of filtering equipment.\n(e) Other effective means."
