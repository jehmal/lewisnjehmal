  "fullText": "Every conductor shall have a current-carrying capacity in accordance with the AS/NZS 3008.1 series, not less than the current to be carried by the conductor.\nIn determining the required current-carrying capacity, provision shall be made for reasonably foreseeable changes to external influences, such as the installation of thermal insulation in ceiling spaces and walls.\nWiring\tsystems\tin\tdomestic\tinstallations\tshall\tbe\tinstalled\ton\tthe assumption that thermal insulation in ceilings, walls and under floors, if not currently installed, will be installed in the future.\nNOTES:\n1\tAppendix C, Paragraph C3 provides a set of current ratings that may be assigned to circuits in typical simple installations as an alternative to compliance with the AS/NZS 3008.1 series. The ratings assign cable current-carrying capacities that are aligned with the current rating of protective devices.\n2\tNational building codes contain mandatory requirements for the thermal insulation of ceilings and walls in certain situations.\n3\tThe AS/NZS 5000 series of cable standards provide higher operating temperature materials for some cable insulation than was the case with their predecessors.\n4\tCurrent-carrying capacities for busbars and busways should be obtained from the manufacturer. Information relating to busways is given in AS/NZS 3439.2 or AS/NZS 61439.6."
