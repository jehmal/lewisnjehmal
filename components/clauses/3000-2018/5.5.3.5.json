  "title": "Unprotected Consumer Mains",
  "fullText": "Exposed conductive parts associated with consumer mains not provided with short-circuit protection on the supply side shall be earthed by a conductor or by direct connection to an earth bar such that either has a current-carrying capacity not less than that of the main neutral conductor. Unprotected consumer mains are those that are not protected by a service protective device as shown in Figure 2.1.\nNOTE: Short-circuit of an unprotected active conductor to a switchboard surround, riser bracket, etc. will cause the earthing conductor to continuously carry the maximum fault current available through those consumer mains. Reduced sizes for protective earthing conductors in other situations are permitted because the fault current is of limited duration.\nThis conductor shall be connected to: (a) the main neutral conductor or bar [see Figure 5.6(A)]; or (b) the main earthing terminal/connection or bar, in which case, in accordance with Clause 5.3.5.2, the cross-sectional area of the MEN connection shall be not less than that of the main neutral conductor [see Figure 5.6(B)].\nException: Where double insulation of the consumer mains conductors is maintained up to the supply terminals of the service protective device(s), and short-circuit protection is provided by that device, this requirement need not apply [see Figure 5.6(C)].\nNOTES:\n1.\tA system that is deemed to provide double insulation for aerial conductors would include use of XLPE type X-90UV cable to AS/NZS 3560 with insulated strain clamps and double insulated connectors to AS/NZS 4396.\n2.\tExposed conductive parts associated with consumer mains include: (a) switchboard cases, surrounds, and enclosures; (b) wiring enclosures; (c) boxes and accessories; and (d) supports for aerial conductors.\n3.\tA distributor's upstream service protective device may provide short-circuit protection of consumer mains."
