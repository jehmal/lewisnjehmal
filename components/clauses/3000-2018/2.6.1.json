  "fullText": "The use of fixed setting RCDs with a rated operating residual current not exceeding 30 mA is recognized as providing additional protection in areas where excessive earth leakage current in the event of failure of other measures of protection or carelessness by users could present a significant risk of electric shock.\nNOTE: The use of RCDs is intended only to augment other measures of basic protection.\nRCDs do not provide protection against faults between live conductors, nor do they provide protection against voltages imported into the electrical installation earthing system through the supply system neutral conductor.\nThe use of such devices is not recognized as a sole means of protection and does not obviate the need to apply the protective measures specified in Clause 2.4.\nAdditional protection shall be provided, where required by Clause 2.6.3, to automatically disconnect the supply when an earth leakage current reaches a predetermined value.\nNOTES:\n1\tThe requirements in these rules are for RCDs with a maximum sensitivity of 30 mA (can be either 10 mA or 30 mA).\n2\tRCDs with a sensitivity of 30 mA are designed to operate before fibrillation of the heart occurs.\n3\tRCDs with a sensitivity of 10 mA are designed to operate before muscular contraction, or inability to let go occurs. Muscular contraction can result in inability to breathe. Infants may be more prone to this risk."
