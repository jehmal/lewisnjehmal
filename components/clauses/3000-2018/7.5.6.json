    "fullText": "The following applies for PELV circuits, where one conductor of the output circuit is earthed:\nBasic protection shall be provided by:\n(a) Barriers or enclosures affording a degree of protection of at least IPXXB or IP2X; or\n(b) Insulation capable of withstanding a test voltage of 500 V a.c. for 1 min.\nException: Basic protection shall be deemed unnecessary if electrical equipment is within the zone of influence of equipotential bonding and the nominal voltage does not exceed:\n1.\t25 V a.c. or 60 V ripple-free d.c., when electrical equipment is normally used in a dry location only and large-area contact with the human body is not to be expected; or\n2.\t6 V a.c. or 15 V ripple-free d.c., in all other cases.\nNOTES:\n1.\tThe earthing of circuits may be achieved by an appropriate connection to earth within the source itself.\n2.\tAS/NZS 60479 indicates that large-area contact is approximately 8000 mmÂ².\n3.\tInsulation is capable of withstanding the test voltage for the required period when the insulation resistance, after the test voltage has been applied for the specified period, remains above the required minimum value."
