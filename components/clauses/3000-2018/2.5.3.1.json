   "fullText": "The operating characteristics of a device protecting a conductor against overload shall satisfy the following two conditions:\n\n\\( I_B \\leq I_N \\leq I_Z \\) \\( \\quad \\dots 2.1 \\)\n\n\\( I_2 \\leq 1.45 I_Z \\) \\( \\quad \\dots 2.2 \\)\n\nwhere\n\n\\( I_B \\) = the current for which the circuit is designed, e.g. maximum demand\n\n\\( I_N \\) = the nominal current of the protective device\n\n\\( I_Z \\) = the continuous current-carrying capacity of the conductor (see the AS/NZS 3008.1 series)\n\n\\( I_2 \\) = the current ensuring effective operation of the protective device and may be taken as equal to either—\n\n(a) the operating current in conventional time for circuit-breakers (\\( 1.45 I_N \\)); or\n\n(b) the fusing current in conventional time for fuses (\\( 1.6 I_N \\) for fuses in accordance with the IEC 60269 series).\n\nNOTES:\n\n1 To satisfy Equation 2.2, the nominal current \\( I_N \\) of a fuse should not exceed 90% of \\( I_Z \\) (\\( 1.45/1.6 = 0.9 \\)), therefore—\n\nfor circuit-breakers Equation 2.1 applies\n\nfor HRC fuses \\( I_B \\leq I_N \\leq 0.9 I_Z \\) \\( \\quad \\dots 2.3 \\)\n\n2 For adjustable devices, the nominal current \\( I_N \\) is the current setting selected.\n\n3 Protection in accordance with this Clause will not ensure complete protection in certain cases, e.g. against sustained overcurrent less than \\( I_Z \\), nor will it necessarily result in an economical solution. Therefore, it is assumed that the circuit is so designed that small overloads of long duration will not frequently occur. Such overloads can cause premature ageing of the insulation.\n\n4 For further information, see Paragraph B3.2.1, Appendix B."
