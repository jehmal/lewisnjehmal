  "fullText": "The telephone and telecommunication earthing system may be connected in common with the electrical installation earthing system in order to minimize the risk associated with different voltages appearing on the two systems.\nIf the telephone and telecommunication earthing system is directly connected to the electrical installation earthing system, it shall be connected either: (a) to the electrical installation earthing system at an enclosed terminal provided for the purpose; or (b) directly to the earth electrode by an independent connecting device, and shall be clearly identified.\nIf an enclosed terminal is used, the following conditions shall apply: (i) The terminal shall be connected by means of a protective earthing conductor to the main earthing conductor of the electrical installation earthing system in accordance with the connection methods specified in Clause 5.5.2. (ii) The terminal shall not be installed within a switchboard. (iii) The terminal shall be installed in a convenient and readily accessible position. (iv) The minimum cross-sectional area of the protective earthing conductor used for the connection shall be 6 mmÂ².\nNOTES:\n1.\tRequirements for the installation of telecommunications earthing systems in Australia are contained in AS/CA S009, Installation requirements for customer cabling (Wiring Rules).\n2.\tRecommendations for New Zealand are contained in the TCF Premises Wiring Code of Practice.\n3.\tRefer to Appendix F for further detail of the bonding arrangement."
