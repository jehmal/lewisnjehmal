    "fullText": "The drop in voltage at any point in an extra-low voltage electrical installation shall not exceed 10% of the nominal value when all live conductors are carrying the circuit-operating current.\nNOTE: Information on voltage drop is given in the AS/NZS 3008.1 series.\nException: This requirement need not apply where electrical equipment is specially designed for operation with a voltage drop greater than 10%.\nNOTE: Motor starting, solenoid closing and other similar applications where high transient currents may be experienced that can significantly increase voltage drop are excluded from consideration."
