  "fullText": "A switchboard or switchboards shall be provided in an electrical installation for the mounting or the enclosure of switchgear and protective devices.\n\nExceptions:\n1. This requirement need not apply to switchgear and protective devices installed in a ground-mounted, cable-distribution cabinet in accordance with AS/NZS 3439.5 or AS/NZS 61439.5, that protect small submains teed off larger submains forming an underground reticulated wiring system and to which unskilled persons do not require access.\n2. Where it is necessary to connect small submains to larger submains, e.g. teeing-off large rising submains at each floor, or from large submains to a number of circuits at a switchboard, a short branch (length shall not exceed three metres) from a submain to a switchboard may be made with conductors of smaller current-carrying capacity, provided that such conductors comply with Clause 2.4.\nAlternatively, the small submains may be protected by fuses or circuit-breakers complying with Clause 2.4 of this Standard in relation to the smaller conductors and suitably mounted or fixed at the point of teeing-off. If there are more than two tee-offs per phase at any one point, the fuses or circuit-breakers shall be deemed to constitute a switchboard.\n\nA main switchboard shall be provided for each electrical installation for the primary control and protective devices of the electrical installation including the main switch or switches.\n\nException: A main switch need not be located on a switchboard, or be readily accessible, where unauthorized operation may impair safety and the electrical installation isâ€”\n(a) located on public land; and\n(b) associated with telephone cabinets, traffic control signals and street furniture, such as bus shelters and the like; and\n(c) otherwise controlled and protected in accordance with the requirements of this Standard."
