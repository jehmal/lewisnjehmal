  "title": "Disconnection Times",
  "fullText": "The maximum disconnection time for a 230 V supply voltage shall not exceed the following:\n(a) 0.4 s for final subcircuits that supply: (i) socket-outlets having rated currents not exceeding 63 A; or (ii) hand-held Class I equipment; or (iii) portable equipment intended for manual movement during use.\n(b) 5 s for other circuits where it can be shown that people are not exposed to touch voltages that exceed safe values. Refer to Appendix B, Paragraph B4.\nNOTES:\n1.\tMaximum disconnection times will vary for other operating voltages or installation conditions, such as wet locations, etc.\n2.\tThe fault current has to be of sufficient magnitude to cause automatic disconnection within the required times.\n3.\tSee Clauses 1.5 and 2.4.2."
