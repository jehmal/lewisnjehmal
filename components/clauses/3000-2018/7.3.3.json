  "fullText": "An electricity generation system shall be controlled by a main switch or switches at the installation switchboard to which the connection of the electricity generation system is made. The electricity generation system shall be controlled by switches or devices suitable for starting and stopping the electricity generation system. Where there is more than one switch or device for this purpose, they shall be grouped together and clearly identified.\nAn electricity generation system shall be so arranged that it cannot supply energy upstream of the point of connection to the installation either directly or indirectly.\nException: An electricity distributor may enter into a formal agreement to permit co-generation (feedback or exporting into the upstream network) under specific conditions. Examples include grid-connected inverter-based systems or engine-driven generating systems intended to operate in parallel with the network.\nNOTE: Conditions for the connection of grid-connected systems, co-generation, and other systems that are intended to operate in parallel with the electricity distributor's system are beyond the scope of this Standard."
