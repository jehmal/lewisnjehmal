  "fullText": "Wiring associated with switchboards shall be installed in such a manner that, in the event of fire originating at the switchboard, the spread of fire will be kept to a minimum.\nWhere a switchboard is enclosed in a case or surround, any wiring systems entering the switchboard enclosure shall pass through openings that provide a close fit.\nNOTES:\n1\tSee also Clause 2.10.2.5(h) regarding restricted location of switchboards in or near egress paths or fire exits and Clause 3.9.9 regarding requirements to prevent the spread of fire.\n2\tThere is a very high risk that wiring enclosures, especially those that enter at the top or sides of a switchboard, will contribute to the spread of fire and for this reason care needs to be taken to ensure that these wiring systems are provided with close-fitting entries. In some cases internal sealing should be provided.\n3\tAn opening with less than 5 mm diameter of free space is considered to be a close fit. Therefore, any opening of 5 mm diameter or greater requires sealing with a fire-retardant sealant.\n4\tWiring enclosures, such as conduits, having an internal free space of greater than 5 mm diameter also require sealing to stop any draft effect that could allow the spread of fire."
