  "fullText": "An installation coupler, enclosed or unenclosed, that meets the requirements of AS/NZS 61535 is a suitable method for the electrical connection of cables, including flexible cords, flexible cables and rigid (solid or stranded) cables.\nNOTES:\n1\tInstallation couplers are intended for permanent connection between sections of wiring, particularly in 'soft' wiring systems, in which case they are treated in the same manner as a junction box.\n2\tInstallation couplers require a deliberate act to disengage the latching mechanism and are not intended to be engaged or disconnected under load or to be used as socket-outlets.\nWiring from an installation coupler to electrical equipment is regarded as installation wiring (see Figure 4.4).\nException: Where the manufacturer of an item of electrical equipment provides supply terminals for the equipment at a plug designed for connection to an installation coupler, the wiring between the plug and the equipment is regarded as equipment wiring (see Figure 4.5)."
