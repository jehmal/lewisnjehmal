    "fullText": "In addition to the testing requirements of Section 8, the separation of each separated circuit (transformer secondary winding or isolated winding generator output) and the wiring to the socket-outlet shall be individually confirmed.\nSeparation shall be verified by a measurement of the insulation resistance between the separated circuit and:\n(a) if a transformer is the source of the separated supply, the transformer primary winding;\n(b) any other wiring;\n(c) any other separated circuit; and\n(d) earth.\nInsulation resistance values obtained shall be not less than 1 MΩ, when tested at a voltage of 500 V d.c.\nNOTE: Where final subcircuits are not of significant length, the insulation resistance of the separated circuit should be significantly greater than 1 MΩ, e.g., with short lengths (say 50 m) of polymeric cable, a value in excess of 50 MΩ would be expected."
