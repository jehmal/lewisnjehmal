  "fullText": "Active conductors shall be protected by one or more devices that automatically disconnect the supply in the event of overcurrent, before such overcurrent attains a magnitude or duration that could cause injury to persons or livestock or damage because of excessive temperatures or electromechanical stresses in the electrical installation.\nNo fuse shall be inserted in a neutral conductor. Protective devices that incorporate a switching function in the neutral conductor shall comply with the requirements of Clause 2.3.2.1.2(b).\nProtection against overcurrent shall consist of protection againstâ€”\n(a)\toverload current, in accordance with Clauses 2.5.2 and 2.5.3; and\n(b)\tshort-circuit current, in accordance with Clauses 2.5.2 and 2.5.4.\nProtection against overload current and short-circuit current shall be coordinated, in accordance with Clause 2.5.6.\nNOTES:\n1\tOvercurrent protection is inseparably linked to the current-carrying capacity and temperature limits of the protected cable.\nReduction in current-carrying capacity of conductors may occur by a change in cross-sectional area, method of installation, or type of cable or conductor.\n2\tAppendix I provides guidance on the ratings of overload protective devices where alterations or repairs involve the use of existing imperial conductors."
