  "fullText": "Protective devices, such as arc fault detection devices (AFDDs), may be used to protect against the effects of arc faults for final subcircuits, including fire hazards. Typical applications include the following:\n(a)\tIn premises with sleeping accommodation.\n(b)\tIn locations with risks of fire due to the nature of processed or stored materials (e.g. barns, wood-working shops, stores of combustible materials).\n(c)\tIn locations with combustible construction materials (e.g. wooden buildings).\n(d)\tIn fire propagating structures.\nNOTE: See Appendix O for more details.\nWhere AFDDs are installed, the requirements of Clauses 2.9.2 to 2.9.4 apply.\nNOTE: The use of AFDDs does not obviate the need to apply any other measures required by other clauses in this Standard."
