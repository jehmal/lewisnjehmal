  "fullText": "Wiring enclosures shall beâ€”\n(a)\tinstalled in a manner that will prevent water from entering electrical equipment and enclosures; and\n(b)\twhere exposed to the weather, provided with adequate means to prevent the entry of rain.\nNOTE: The relationship between the height of each end of a wiring enclosure and the risk of entry of water should be considered, e.g. a conduit installed on a hill from an underground connection pit to a switchboard enclosure that is much lower than the connection pit."
