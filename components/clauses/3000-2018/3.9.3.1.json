  "fullText": "Wiring systems shall be supported by suitable means to comply with Clause 3.3.2.8.\nWiring systems shall be fixed in position by suitable clips, saddles or clamps or by means that will not damage the wiring system and that will not be affected by the wiring system material or any external influences.\nFor wiring systems installed in building elements, the positioning and size of openings and checks shall not reduce the structural strength of those building elements below the levels required by national building codes.\nNOTES:\n1\tLimits for the size of openings and checks made in structural members are contained in national building codes.\n2\tIn New Zealand, this information may also be found in NZS 3604.\nWhere a wiring system consisting of sheathed cables is installed through metallic structural members, any aperture through which the cable passes shall be bushed or shaped to minimize abrasion of the cable. Where likely to be disturbed, the cable shall be fixed in position at a point adjacent to the aperture.\nNOTE: Fixing of individual cores of a cable may be required where the risk of contact with conductive structural building materials exists (see Clause 5.4.6).\nExceptions:\n1\tWhere a wiring system is resting on an immovable continuous surface, no further support is required.\n2\tSpecific methods of fixing outlined in this Standard do not prohibit the use of alternative methods, provided that an equivalent degree of support and strength is maintained."
