  "fullText": "The prospective short-circuit current and prospective earth fault current shall be assessed for each electricity generation system or combination of systems that can operate to supply an installation. The short-circuit rating of protective devices within the electrical installation shall not be exceeded for any of the intended methods of operation of the electricity generation system.\nNOTE: If the electricity generation system has an electronic overcurrent protection system fitted, e.g., inverters, such devices may automatically limit the output current and may prevent the operation of an external overcurrent device within the installation under fault conditions.\nEvery circuit outgoing from an electricity generation system shall be individually protected in accordance with Clause 2.5 and shall also include additional (earth leakage) protection where required by Clause 2.6. A circuit is considered to be protected against prospective short-circuit and earth fault currents when it is supplied from an electricity generation system incapable of delivering a current exceeding the current-carrying capacity of the circuit.\nNOTE: Typical supply sources include small generating sets or inverters fitted with electronic overload protection systems.\nException: Overcurrent protective devices shall not be provided where the unexpected interruption of the supply could cause a greater danger than overcurrent."
