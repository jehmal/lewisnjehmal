  "title": "Conductive Pool Structures",
  "fullText": "Where the pool structure is conductive, all extraneous conductive parts, including the reinforcing metal of the pool shell or deck, shall be connected to a pool equipotential bonding conductor connection point complying with Clause 5.6.2.6.3. The connection point shall also be bonded to the earthing conductors associated with each circuit supplying the pool or spa, or the earthing bar at the switchboard at which the circuits originate.\nWhere the pool structure is conductive, the connection point shall be installed and bonded to the installation earthing system regardless of other requirements specified in Clauses 5.6.2.6.4 and 5.6.2.6.5.\nException: This requirement need not apply where the reinforcing metal of the pool shell or deck is electrically continuous (0.5 Î©) to the reinforcing metal within the concrete floor of the electrical installation, and that reinforcing metal has been bonded to the earthing system of the electrical installation as required in Clause 5.6.2.5.\nNOTES:\n1.\tConnections to the conductive reinforcement of the pool will generally be subject to the effects of water during the construction phase and to subsequent dampness.\n2.\tConductive tie-wires used during construction of reinforced concrete pools are considered to be an adequate electrical bond between the conductive reinforcing components. Provided that the reinforcement is satisfactorily electrically connected together, one point of connection of the bonding conductor to the reinforcement is sufficient."
