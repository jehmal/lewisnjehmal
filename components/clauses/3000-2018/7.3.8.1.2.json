    "fullText": "The changeover device for an alternative supply shall be selected to maintain the function of, and prevent damage to, the electrical installation being supplied. Functions to be maintained include the maintenance of the continuity of the neutral conductor (overlapping of neutrals), the operation of RCDs, or the continued operation of uninterruptible power supplies.\nThe changeover device shall open all active conductors of the normal supply when the alternative supply is connected.\nWhere the operation of a switch automatically brings into service an alternative supply, the purpose of the switch shall be marked accordingly.\nSwitching arrangements in accordance with AS/NZS 3010 are deemed to satisfy these requirements.\nNOTE: Typical switching arrangements are shown in Figures 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6."
