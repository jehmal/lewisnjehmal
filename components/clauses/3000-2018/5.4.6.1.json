  "fullText": "•\tStructural metalwork forming the frame of a structure containing an electrical installation or part thereof, including sheds or similar structures that are permanently connected to the electrical installation wiring, shall be earthed. The size of the earthing conductor used for earthing the frames shall be determined from Clause 5.3.3 in relation to the cross-sectional area of the largest active conductor that is contained within the framework of that electrical installation.\n•\tFor combined outbuildings, each outbuilding shall contain its own individual A1 earthing connection to the conductive frames within that outbuilding.\nAll other conductive building materials shall be earthed where: (a) the risk of contact with live parts of electrical equipment or insulated, unsheathed cables exists; or (b) double insulation or cables in contact with conductive building materials is not permanently and effectively maintained.\nThe breaking of a conductor at a termination shall not result in contact between unearthed conductive building material and: (i) live parts; or (ii) parts separated from live parts by single insulation.\nThis requirement may be satisfied by: (A) restraining the conductor by tying, lacing, or clipping; or (B) containing the termination within a non-conductive shroud or enclosure."
