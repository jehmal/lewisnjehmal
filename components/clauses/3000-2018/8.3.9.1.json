  "fullText": "Where an installation includes circuits satisfying (a), (b), and (c) below, EFLI testing, in accordance with Clause 8.3.9.2, shall be carried out for those circuits:\n(a) Fault protection is by automatic disconnection of supply. (b) Supplying one or more socket-outlets. (c) Where socket-outlets are not protected by a residual current device with a residual current rating of 30 mA or less.\nNotes:\n1.\tThe tests described in Clause 8.3.9.2 are carried out to verify that the protective device will operate to disconnect an earth fault current within the time and touch voltage requirements of Clauses 5.7 and 1.5.5.3.\n2.\tFurther information on the earth fault-loop impedance is contained in Appendix B, Paragraph 84, and Clause 5.7.\n3.\tEFLI testing is not required for RCD-protected socket-outlets, as the maximum operating time of RCDs providing additional protection is less than the 0.4 s specified by Clause 5.7.2, Item (a), and Clause 1.5.5.3, Item (d).\n4.\tEFLI testing is not required for socket-outlets on separated supplies because, for these circuits, fault protection is not by automatic disconnection.\n5.\tEFLI testing is not specifically required for circuits supplying equipment other than socket-outlets because of the risk of electric shock when performing the test on live electrical equipment. For a circuit supplying other than socket-outlets, the longer permitted operating time combined with verification of earth continuity in accordance with Clause 8.3.5.2, is considered to adequately verify compliance with Clause 5.7.\n6.\tWhile EFLI testing is not required for other circuits, the maximum trip time requirement still has to be complied with. In most cases, if voltage drop requirements are complied with, the EFLI will be acceptable."
