  "fullText": "The minimum cross-sectional area determined by calculation shall be not less than the value determined by the following equation (applicable only for disconnection times not less than 0.1 s but not exceeding 5 s):\nùëÜ=‚àö(I¬≤t/K¬≤)  ... 5.1\nwhere\n‚Ä¢\tS = cross-sectional area of protective earthing conductor, in mm¬≤\n‚Ä¢\tI = the value of the fault current in amperes (for a.c. r.m.s. value) that would flow through the overcurrent protective device of the circuit concerned in the event of a short-circuit or negligible impedance\n‚Ä¢\tt = the disconnection time of the overcurrent protective device in seconds, corresponding to the value of fault current I\n‚Ä¢\tK = factor dependent on the material of the protective earthing conductor, the insulation and other parts, and the initial and final temperatures\nNotes:\n1.\tValues of K for protective earthing conductors in various conditions of service are given in the AS/NZS 3008.1 series, e.g., for copper conductors not laid up with other conductors, with PVC insulation K = 136, or for bare copper conductors K = 170.\n2.\tExamples of the application of this equation are contained in the AS/NZS 3008.1 series.\n3.\tIf the application of the equation produces non-standard sizes, conductors of the nearest higher standard cross-sectional area shall be used.\n4.\tMaximum permissible temperatures for joints should be considered (see the AS/NZS 3008.1 series)."
