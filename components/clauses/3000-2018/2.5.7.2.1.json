  "fullText": "Coordination of protective devices requires consideration of both discrimination (selectivity) and backup (cascading) protection.\n\nDiscrimination (selectivity) between protective devices depends on the operating characteristics of two or more protective devices such that the protective device for the downstream circuit shall operate for a given fault current while the protective device(s) for the upstream circuit shall not operate.\n\nBackup (cascading) depends on the characteristics of each of the two devices as well as the behaviour of the two devices when operating in series. This includes the energy let through when sharing the fault as well as the peak current withstand of the downstream device.\n\nNOTE: Manufacturer's instructions/data should be used where available.\n\nFigure 2.12 provides a generic overview of discrimination (selectivity) between protective devices.\n\nNOTES:\n1. Discrimination (selectivity) is achieved when PD 1 remains intact while PD 2 clears a fault on the load side. Thus supply is maintained to PD 3 and the remainder of the electrical installation.\n2. For examples and detailed requirements of compliant time-current curves, see Figures 2.13 to 2.18.\n3. Discrimination (selectivity) need not apply where protective devices are in series on the same circuits such as in UPS connected supplies."
