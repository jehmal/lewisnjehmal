NOTE: See Appendix H for further information regarding the application of the WS classification system.\nWhere the Australian, New Zealand, or Australian/New Zealand Standard does not specify a WS classification, the wiring system shall be of a type that is: (a) capable of maintaining supply to the equipment when exposed to either fire or mechanical damage; or (b) capable of maintaining supply to the equipment when exposed to fire and that is protected against mechanical damage by: (i) Installation in an effective enclosure; or (ii) installation in a location where the system will not be exposed to mechanical damage.\nException: The fire and mechanical protection requirements specified in Items (a) and (b) above need not apply to wiring systems in an enclosure or location that provides protection against fire and mechanical damage. For example, wiring systems installed in underground locations, buried in concrete or masonry walls or floors, or installed in an appropriate fire-rated enclosure and provided with effective mechanical protection."
