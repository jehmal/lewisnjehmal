  "title": "Conductive Supports for Aerial Conductors",
  "fullText": "Conductive poles, posts, struts, brackets, stay wires, and other conductive supports for low voltage aerial conductors shall be earthed.\nExceptions:\n1.\tConductive supports effectively and permanently separated from all conductors by double insulation need not be earthed. An acceptable method would include the use of XLPE type X-90UV cable to AS/NZS 3560 with insulated strain clamps and double insulated connectors to AS/NZS 4396.\n2.\tConductive supports effectively and permanently separated from aerial conductors by insulators mounted on timber, or other insulating supports, need not be earthed where the space between the conductors and the conductive supports is not less than:\n•\tFor single-core conductors, half the space between the conductors as specified in Clause 3.12.5.4; or\n•\tFor multi-core conductors, 100 mm.\n3.\tConductive supports beyond arm's reach and effectively and permanently separated from any conductive guttering, roof, or structural metalwork by a clearance or creepage distance of at least 25 mm need not be earthed.\n4.\tAny stay wire that is attached to a conductive support fitted with a robust strain insulator so that any portion of the stay wire that is within arm's reach and that is readily accessible is isolated from the remainder of the stay wire, need not be earthed."
