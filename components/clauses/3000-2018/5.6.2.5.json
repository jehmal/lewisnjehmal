  "fullText": "Any conductive reinforcing within a concrete floor or wall of a room containing a shower or bath shall be bonded to the earthing system of the electrical installation.\nAn equipotential bonding conductor, in accordance with Clause 5.6.3, shall be connected between the reinforcing material and any part of the earthing system. For a combined outbuilding, each structure within that outbuilding that contains a shower or bathroom shall contain its own individual bonding connection to the conductive reinforcing within that structure.\nProviding the reinforcement is electrically continuous across the whole of the combined outbuilding (refer to Note 3), one bonding conductor connecting the reinforcement to the earth bar or link of the switchboard that supplies all of the combined outbuilding is satisfactory.\nNOTES:\n1.\tThis requirement is intended to avoid any potential differences that may occur between conductive material connected to, or in contact with, the electrical installation earthing system or earthed electrical appliances and the concrete floor or wall.\n2.\tA conductive grille or reinforcement mesh laid in the floor and connected to the equipotential bonding conductor may also be used.\n3.\tConductive tie-wires used during construction of reinforced concrete structures are considered to be an adequate electrical bond between the conductive reinforcing components. Provided that the reinforcement is satisfactorily electrically connected together, one point of connection of the bonding conductor to the reinforcement is sufficient.\n4.\tIn existing electrical installations, the bonding requirement of this Clause for concrete floors and walls containing conductive reinforcing need not apply, but should be adopted wherever practicable."
