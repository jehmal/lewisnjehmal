  "fullText": "NOTE: The term 'insulation system' does not mean that the insulation has to be one homogenous piece. It may comprise several layers that cannot be tested separately as supplementary or basic insulation.\nOne, or a combination of, the following:\n• (a) Basic insulation: The insulation applied to live parts, to provide basic protection against electric shock.\nNOTE: Basic insulation does not necessarily include insulation used exclusively for functional purposes.\n• (b) Supplementary insulation: An independent insulation applied in addition to basic insulation in order to ensure protection against electric shock in the event of a failure of the basic insulation.\n• (c) Double insulation: Insulation comprising both basic insulation and supplementary insulation.\nNOTE: Sheathed cables in accordance with the AS/NZS 5000 series, sheathed flexible cords in accordance with AS/NZS 3191 other than the 'light duty' type, and sheathed neutral-screened cables in accordance with AS/NZS 4961 are deemed to provide double insulation between the conductors of the cable and any conductive material in contact with the cable. The use of flexible cords of the 'light duty' type as supply flexible cords is covered in equipment Standards.\n• (d) Reinforced insulation: A single insulation system applied to live parts that provides a degree of protection against electric shock, equivalent to double insulation under conditions specified in AS/NZS 3100.\nNOTE: Aerial bundled cables in accordance with AS/NZS 3560 are deemed to provide reinforced insulation."
