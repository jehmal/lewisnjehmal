  "fullText": "Single-core cables armoured with steel wire or tape shall not be used for a.c. circuits.\nConductors of a.c. circuits installed in ferromagnetic enclosures shall be arranged so that the conductors of all phases and the neutral conductor (if any) and the appropriate protective earthing conductor of each circuit are contained in the same enclosure.\nWhere such conductors enter a ferrous enclosure they shall be—\n(a)\tarranged so that the conductors are not individually surrounded by a ferrous material; or\n(b)\tprovided with other means of limiting any excessive heating effects of eddy (induced) currents.\nNOTES:\n1\tParticular care needs to be taken where single-core cables carrying current in excess of 300 A pass through ferrous metal wall lining, switchboard surrounds, or similar ferrous enclosures.\n2\tThe use of non-ferrous enclosures or gland plates or, where suitable, providing an air gap by slotting between individual core entries to break the magnetic circuit may be applied to eliminate this effect. A slot between individual core entries with a width of 20% of the individual core entries diameter is considered satisfactory."
