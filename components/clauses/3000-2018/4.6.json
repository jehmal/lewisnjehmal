  "fullText": "National building codes and state legislation have requirements for installation of smoke alarms including location, number required and interconnection for alarm purposes.\nWhere mains-powered smoke alarms are fitted, such alarms may be directly connected to the lighting final subcircuit or to an individual final subcircuit.\nNOTES:\n1\tUse of the lighting final subcircuit provides indication that the mains power supply is available, as a loss of supply to smoke alarms in an electrical installation would be indicated by the non-operation of lighting.\n2\tSmoke alarms are not considered to be safety services for the purposes of this Standard."
