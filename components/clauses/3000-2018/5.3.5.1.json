  "fullText": "In every electrical installation, there must be an MEN connection (also known as the MEN link) at the main switchboard.\n\nNote: The function of the MEN connection is to connect the earthing system within the electrical installation to the supply neutral conductor by means of a connection from the main earthing terminal/connection or bar to the earthing terminal on the main neutral bar (refer to Figure 5.1).\n\nExceptions:\n1. The NE connection may be made at an earth bar within an owner or user-operated supply substation (refer to Figure 5.2).\n2. The NE connection may be made at an electricity distributor neutral bar within the electrical installation, e.g., at the supply substation or meter panel, if required by the distributor.\n3. The NE connection may be made through an earthing conductor or terminal, provided by the electricity distributor.\n\nNote: An earthing conductor or terminal provided by the electricity distributor may include a special earthing conductor, the conductive sheath of a supply cable, or a neutral bar at a substation.\n\nâ€¢ The MEN or NE connection should be located in an accessible position for disconnection and testing purposes."
