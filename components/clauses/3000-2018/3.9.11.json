  "title": "MINIMIZATION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE",
  "fullText": "Certain types of electrical installations, e.g. those containing sensitive electronic equipment or systems, may require minimization of electromagnetic interference arising from magnetic fields developed from current flowing in cables. This may be addressed byâ€”\n(a)\tselection of cables designed for low magnetic field emissions;\n(b)\tinstallation of cables in enclosures that contain or shield magnetic fields; or\n(c)\tinstallation of cables in configurations that produce low magnetic fields.\nNOTE: The AS/NZS 3008.1 series details circuit configurations for the installation of parallel single-core cables in groups that produce reduced levels of magnetic field in comparison with other electrically symmetrical configurations."
