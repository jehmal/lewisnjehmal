  "fullText": "The path for the circulation of fault current, the earth fault-loop, in a MEN system comprises the following parts:\n(a) The active conductor as far as the point of the fault, including supply mains, service line, consumer mains, submains (if any) and the final subcircuit. (b) The protective earthing conductor (PE), including the main earthing terminal/connection or bar and MEN connection. (c) The neutral-return path, consisting of the neutral conductor (N) between the main neutral terminal or bar and the neutral point at the transformer, including supply mains, service line and consumer mains. (d) The path through the neutral point of the transformer and the transformer winding.\nNOTE: See Appendix B, Figure B5."
