  "title": "Neutral Bar",
  "fullText": "Every switchboard, to which a neutral conductor is connected, shall be provided with a neutral bar that is:\n(a) of adequate current-carrying capacity;\nNOTE: The current-carrying capacity of the incoming neutral conductor may be used as a guide.\n(b) located in an accessible position to allow all conductors to be safely connected without moving other cables or isolating the supply to the switchboard;\n(c) designed such that the incoming neutral conductor cannot be inadvertently disconnected from the bar or link; and\n(d) provided with a separate terminal for:\n(i) the incoming neutral conductor terminating at the switchboard; and\n(ii) the neutral conductor(s) associated with each outgoing circuit originating at the switchboard.\nWhere tunnel-type terminals are provided, the provisions of Clause 2.10.4.2 shall apply.\nA neutral conductor or busbar connection may be used between the neutral bar and a number of multi-pole devices mounted on the switchboard. Where such an arrangement is used, the connection device shall comply with Clause 2.10.4.1 and, where appropriate, Clause 2.10.4.2.\nWhere a cable is used as the neutral conductor, and is looped between devices on the line side, the connection to each device shall be such that continuity remains when the device is removed. Twisting of conductors is not adequate.\nException: Where the connection is made at a terminal of switchgear in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications, the provisions of Clauses 2.10.4.1 and 2.10.4.2 need not apply."
