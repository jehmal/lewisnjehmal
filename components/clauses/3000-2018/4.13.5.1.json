  "title": "ELECTRICITY CONVERTER PROTECTION",
  "fullText": "Electricity converters shall be provided with overcurrent protection.\nException: Overcurrent protective devices shall not be provided where the unexpected interruption of the supply could cause a greater danger than overcurrent.\nOvercurrent protective devices shall be located as close as practicable to the output terminals of the electricity converter so that the unprotected interconnecting conductors are as short as practicable and, in no case, exceed 15 m in length.\nThe unprotected interconnecting conductors shall be completely enclosed by metal or other material that is not flammable.\nException: Overcurrent protection may be provided byâ€”\n(a)\tan overcurrent protective device within the electricity converter itself; or\n(b)\tthe characteristics of the electricity converter being unable to support the fault current.\nWhere an electricity converter is intended to operate in parallel with a network or other source, circulating harmonic currents shall be limited so that the current-carrying capacity of conductors is not exceeded.\nNOTE: The effects of circulating harmonic currents may be limited as follows:\n(a)\tThe selection of generating sets with compensated windings.\n(b)\tThe provision of a suitable impedance in the connection to generator star points.\n(c)\tThe provision of switches that interrupt the circulatory circuit but that are interlocked so that at all times fault protection is not impaired.\n(d)\tThe provision of filtering equipment.\n(e)\tOther suitable means."
