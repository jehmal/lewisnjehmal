  "title": "SELECTION AND INSTALLATION",
  "fullText": "Electrical equipment shall be selected and installed to perform the following functions or to have the following features:\n(a)\tEnable the electrical equipment to function properly under external influences to which it is expected to be exposed.\n(b)\tPrevent any adverse effects that the electrical equipment might cause on the electrical installation.\n(c)\tOperate safely when properly assembled, installed and connected to supply.\n(d)\tEnsure that there is no danger from electric shock, fire, high temperature or physical injury in the event of reasonably expected conditions of overload, abnormal operation, fault or external influences.\n(e)\tInstalled in accordance with the requirements of this Section, and the additional requirements as specified in the manufacturer's instructions.\nThis Standard requires certain electrical equipment to satisfy these provisions through compliance with nominated Australian/New Zealand Standards or other relevant Standards.\nThe requirements of this Section relate to the following:\n(i)\tExternal influences and environmental conditions.\n(ii)\tAdverse effects on the electrical installation and the supply.\n(iii)\tProtection against thermal effects.\n(iv)\tMethods of connection of electrical equipment.\n(v)\tInstallation of socket-outlets, lighting and heating equipment.\n(vi)\tElectricity converters including UPS systems.\n(vii)\tControl, overload and overtemperature protection of motors.\n(viii)\tTransformers.\n(ix)\tCapacitors.\n(x)\tElectrical equipment containing liquid dielectrics.\n(xi)\tSmoke and fire detectors.\nNOTES:\n1  Electrical equipment may be remotely switched. In particular, appliances, such as water heaters, room heaters or airconditioning systems may constitute a 'controlled hours' load. Therefore, care should be taken to ensure isolation of any circuit or equipment switched by an automatic or remote control system when working on such equipment, as electricity supply could be connected without warning.\n*\t2 Refer to Clause 4.7.3 and Figure 4.17 for clearance of socket-outlets and switches from open cooking surfaces.\n3\tRefer to Section 6 for where electrical appliances and accessories are installed\tin\tlocations\tcontaining\ta\tbath,\tshower\tor\tother\tfixed\twater container.\n*\t4\tIn New Zealand, attention is drawn to the requirements of NZECP 55 for wiring and fittings located near conductive thermal insulation."
