  "fullText": "Means of disconnecting electricity supply (shutting down) shall be provided where mechanical maintenance of electrically powered equipment might involve a risk of physical injury.\nNOTES:\n1\tSuch injuries include burns and those caused by radiated heat and unexpected mechanical movements.\n2\tElectrically powered mechanical equipment may include rotating machines, heating elements and electromagnetic equipment.\n3\tExamples of electrical installations where means of shutting down for mechanical maintenance are used include cranes, lifts, escalators, conveyors, machine tools and pumps.\n4\tSystems powered by other means, e.g. pneumatic, hydraulic or steam, are not within the scope of this Clause. In such cases, shutting down any associated supply of electricity may not be sufficient to ensure safety.\nSuitable means, such as facilities for locking the means of shutting down in the open position, the enclosure of the means of shutting down in a lockable enclosure or facilities for the attachment of a warning notice or notices, shall be provided to prevent operation of the means of shutting down and electrically powered equipment from being inadvertently started during mechanical maintenance.\nException: Locking facilities or a lockable enclosure need not be provided where the means of shutting down is continuously under the control of the person performing such maintenance."
