The location of all such RCDs should be recorded at the switchboard from which the final subcircuit originates.\nExceptions: These requirements need not apply to the following:\n1\tWhere socket-outlets that are not RCD-protected are replaced, including the replacement of a single socket-outlet with a multiple socket-outlet assembly.\n2\tWhere socket-outlets are added to an existing subcircuit under circumstances where an exception from either Clause 2.6.3.3.1 or Clause 2.6.3.3.2 applies."
