  "fullText": "This Standard may be applied through legislative requirements, made in each state and territory of Australia and in New Zealand, concerned with the safety of electrical installations. The Standard may also be applied in conjunction with any additional requirements, exemptions, or restrictions in such legislation.\nThe principal application of this Standard is to electrical installations in all types of premises and land used by electricity consumers. However, the Standard may also be referenced or applied through legislative or other requirements relating to the effect of electrical installations in matters such as the following:\n• (a) Safety of workplaces.\n  o NOTE: For example, any relevant work health and safety legislation and associated codes.\n• (b) Safe design and construction of buildings.\n  o NOTE: For example, national building codes [such as the National Construction Code (NCC), New Zealand Building Code (NZBC)] and the associated referenced Standards. See Appendix E for information on NCC and NZBC.\n• (c) Electricity generation, transmission, and distribution systems.\n• (d) Safe connection to electricity distribution systems.\n  o NOTE: For example, service rules and conditions provided by local electricity distributors.\n• (e) Qualifications of electricity workers.\nPart 1 (Section 1) of this Standard provides a mechanism for acceptance of design and installation practices that may not be addressed by those given in Part 2 (Sections 2 to 8) of this Standard. This mechanism is only intended to apply where departures from the methods in Part 2 are significant.\n• NOTE: A degree of flexibility exists within Part 2."
