  "title": "Reduction of the probability of the initiation of a switchboard internal arcing fault",
  "fullText": "Switchboards rated at 800 A or greater per phase shall be provided with internal separation in accordance with AS/NZS 3439.1 or AS/NZS 61439.2 forâ€”\n(a)\tbusbars from functional units;\n(b)\tfunctional units from one another (refer to Figure 2.11);\n(c)\tterminals provided for external conductors from the busbar; and\n(d)\ta safety service circuit section of the switchboard, if any, from the general installation circuit's section, in accordance with Clause 7.2.\nNOTES:\n1\tSeparation in accordance with AS/NZS 3439.1 or AS/NZS 61439.2 may be achieved by the insulation of busbars, the use of barriers or by insulated housings, i.e. by the use of a Form 3b, Form 3bi, Form 3bh, Form 3bih, Form 4a, Form 4ah, Form 4aih or Form 4b, Form 4bi, Form 4bh, Form 4bih constructed switchboard.\n2\tThe required degree of protection, IP2X or IP1XB, is to prevent the entry of objects and contact with live parts by a person's finger. To prevent the entry of tools or wires, the degree of protection may be increased, i.e. small tools IP3X or IP2XC (2.5 mm diameter) and wires IP4X or IP3XD (1 mm diameter).\n3\tInternal arc fault testing of switchboard designs to Annex ZD of AS/NZS 3439.1:2002 or AS/NZS 61439, or IEC/TR 61641 is not required and is considered to be an enhancement of internal separation. These designs are intended to prevent the arc or products of the arc affecting other parts of the switchboard. Arc fault containment is achieved by the arrangement of the busbars and functional units of the switchboard in vented compartments and relies, for its effectiveness, on compartment access doors being closed during a fault. It is not designed to prevent the initiation of a fault during maintenance and is also not designed to provide switching operator or maintenance personnel protection if any covers are not properly fixed in place."
