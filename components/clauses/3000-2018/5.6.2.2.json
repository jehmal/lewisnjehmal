  "title": "Conductive Water Piping",
  "fullText": "Conductive water piping that is both: (a) installed and accessible within the building containing the electrical installation; and (b) continuously conductive from inside the building to a point of contact with the ground, shall be bonded to the earthing system of the electrical installation.\nAny equipotential bonding of conductive water piping shall be effected by means of an equipotential bonding conductor connected to the main earthing conductor or earth terminal or bar. The connection of the bonding conductor to the conductive water piping shall be as close as practicable to the entry of the conductive water piping to the building.\nNOTES:\n1.\tThe main earthing conductor may be continued beyond the earth electrode connecting device to form the equipotential bonding conductor to the conductive water piping. A separate connection to the earth electrode does not constitute a connection to the main earthing conductor and does not comply with this Clause.\n2.\tItem (b) above includes any conductive path through an item of equipment, e.g. a water heater."
