  "fullText": "Where any items specified in Clauses 5.6.2.6.2 or 5.6.2.6.4 are required to be equipotentially bonded, the bonding shall be extended to any fixed conductive material (such as pool ladders, diving boards, conductive fences, pipework and reinforcing metal in a concrete slab) that is installed within arm's reach of the pool edge, and that is in contact with the general mass of earth either directly or indirectly.\nNOTES:\n1.\tThe general mass of earth itself may not provide a low enough impedance to operate a protective device or be suitable as an electrical bond.\n2.\tRefer to Clause 1.4.16 and Figure 1.1 for the zone of arm's reach and Clause 1.4.60 for the definition of equipotential bonding.\nException:\n1.\tWhere any fixed conductive material (such as pool ladders, diving boards, etc.) is installed within arm's reach of the pool edge and is electrically continuous (0.5 Î©) to the reinforcing metal of a concrete slab into which it is installed, and where that reinforcing metal is electrically continuous with the reinforcing metal of the pool shell or deck, then no additional bonding is required.\n2.\tThis requirement need not apply to fixed conductive parts and fittings that are not part of electrical equipment and have no individual accessible part greater than 100 mm in any dimension."
