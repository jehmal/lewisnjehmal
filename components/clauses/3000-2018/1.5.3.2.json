  "fullText": "Protection under normal conditions is provided by basic protective provision, and protection under single fault conditions is provided by fault protective provisions. Alternatively, protection against electric shock is provided by an enhanced protective provision that provides protection under normal conditions and under single fault conditions.\n\nA method of protection shall consist of:\n• (a) an appropriate combination of a provision for basic protection and an independent provision for fault protection; or\n• (b) an enhanced protective provision that provides both basic protection and fault protection.\n\nNOTE: An example of an enhanced method of protection is the use of extra-low voltage or of reinforced insulation.\n\nAdditional protection is specified as part of a method of protection under certain conditions of external influences and in certain special locations.\n\nNOTE: Sections 6 and 7 provide guidance on conditions and special locations requiring additional protection.\n\nDifferent methods of protection applied to the same installation or part of an installation or within equipment shall have no influence on each other such that failure of one method of protection could impair the other methods of protection."
