  "title": "Functional Earthing Conductors",
  "fullText": "Functional earthing conductors are provided solely to ensure the correct operation of electrical equipment or to permit reliable and proper functioning of electrical installations. These conductors need not comply with the requirements for main and protective earthing conductors.\n\nWhere earthing for combined protective and functional purposes is required, the requirements for protective purposes shall prevail.\n\nNotes:\n1. The functional earth connection should be independent of the protective earth to comply with the manufacturer's requirements. Connection would thus be limited to the main earth connection point.\n2. Where a 'clean earth' is specified for a particular item of electrical equipment, the manufacturer should be consulted to confirm the necessary arrangements."
