  "fullText": "(a) The following requirements shall be undertaken for the installation of recessed luminaires:\n(i) Suitably designed and certified recessed luminaires have installation classifications and shall be marked accordingly. The manufacturer's instructions shall provide all details in regard to restrictions for installation in certain applications.\n(ii) Unmarked light fittings shall be treated as 'Do-not-cover'. For these typical fittings, the installation method shall be to provide barriers [see method in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(ii)] or clearances [see method in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(iii)] during installation, so as to prevent contact with materials that may impede airflow (e.g. thermal insulation) or that may be affected by the high temperature (e.g. combustible building elements and insulation).\n(iii) Where building insulation is already fitted and recessed luminaires are retrofitted, added or altered, precautions shall be taken during the installation of the luminaire so as not to compromise the safety of the installation.\n(iv) Unless the recessed luminaire manufacturer specifies otherwise [see method in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(i)] or the barrier is classified to permit insulation coverage [see method in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(ii)], the space above the luminaire shall remain clear. This space is shown as dimension HCB in Figure 4.9.\n(v) Where clearances are to be applied [see method in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(iii)] and bulk thermal insulation is not fixed in position, one of the following means shall be provided and secured in position to maintain the clearances: (A) A barrier complying with AS/NZS 5110. (B) A guard complying with AS 3999. (C) A barrier or guard constructed of fire-resistant materials.\n(vi) Unless the auxiliary equipment instructions permit otherwise, any auxiliary equipment operating at a high temperature shall be installed above any insulation as illustrated in Figure 4.9.\n(vii) If the recessed luminaire is supplied with a detachable barrier, the complete luminaire, including its barrier, shall be installed.\n(viii) For recessed luminaires with lamps of wattage higher than 100 W, only the methods in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(i) or 4.5.2.3.1(b)(iii), shall be used.\n(ix) Combustible materials shall be prevented from being in close proximity or contacting hot surfaces of the recessed luminaires.\n(x) Bulk thermal insulation may also be retrofitted, added or altered, in which case precautions shall be applied by the insulation installer, where recessed luminaires are present, or the luminaire installer, where insulation is present.\n\n(b) The following precautions should be considered for the installation of recessed luminaires:\n(i) The heat generated from lamps should be dissipated in order to prevent overtemperature damage to the luminaire or to adjacent materials.\n(ii) Under National Construction Code requirements, bulk thermal insulation is prevalent in modern building construction within roofs, ceilings, walls and floors depending on the type of building and its climate zone.\n\nNOTES:\n1 In New Zealand, under the New Zealand Building Code, building insulation is required.\n2 Instructions for insulation installers in relation to clearances from recessed luminaires and other types of electrical equipment that may be adversely affected by lack of cooling air circulation are included in AS 3999 in Australia and in New Zealand NZS 4246.",
