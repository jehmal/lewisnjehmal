        "fullText": "To verify that RCDs have been correctly installed, tests shall be performed on all RCDs. The function of the RCD shall be verified either by the operation of the integral test device, or by the use of special test equipment. In all cases, isolation of all switched poles shall be verified after the RCD has operated to disconnect the designated circuit. Isolation of all poles shall be verified by voltage tests or, after removing supply, by continuity checks through each pole.\nNotes:\n1. Tripping the RCD by means of the integral test device establishes:\n• (a) The RCD is functioning correctly; and\n• (b) The integrity of the electrical and mechanical elements of the tripping device.\n2. Operation of the integral test device does not provide a means of checking:\n• (a) The continuity of the main earthing conductor or the associated circuit protective earthing conductors;\n• (b) Any earth electrode or other means of earthing; or\n• (c) Any other part of the associated electrical installation earthing.\n3. Guidance on the suitability of types of RCD is contained in Clause 2.6.2.2.\n4. There is no requirement to test the operating time of RCDs. Operating time is a function of the type of RCD.\n5. A suitable test could be performed using a test plug with a resistor between the active and earth pins."
