The visual inspection shall be carried out before, or in association with, testing. The visual inspection should, where practicable, be made before the relevant part of the electrical installation is placed in service.\nException: Where the visual inspection of a part of the electrical installation is not practicable at the completion of the work, e.g., not accessible because of enclosure in the building structure, consideration should be given to inspecting that part during the course of the installation."
