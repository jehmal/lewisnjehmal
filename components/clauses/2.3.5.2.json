  "fullText": "Means for emergency switching shall consist of—\n(a)\ta single switching device directly interrupting the incoming supply; or\n(b)\ta combination of several items of electrical equipment operated by one single action resulting in the removal of the hazard by interrupting the appropriate supply.\nException: Emergency stopping may include the retention of supply for electric braking facilities.\n*\tDevices for emergency switching shall—\n(i)\tbe capable of breaking the full-load current of the relevant parts of the electrical installation, taking account of stalled motor currents where appropriate; and\n(ii)\tbe manually operated directly interrupting the main circuit, where practicable. A device, such as a circuit-breaker or a contactor operated by remote control, shall open on de-energization of the coil, or another technique of suitable reliability shall be employed; and\n(iii)\tbe provided with means of operation capable of latching or being restrained in the 'OFF' or 'STOP' position; and\n(iv)\tnot re-energize the relevant part of the electrical installation upon release of the device; and\n(v)\twhere danger is likely to occur, require manual reset before the electrical equipment can be started.\nPlugs and socket-outlets shall not be provided for use as a means for emergency switching.\nException: Where electrical equipment is energized from a socket-outlet, a switch associated with the socket-outlet may be used for emergency switching."
