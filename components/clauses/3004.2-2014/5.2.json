    "fullText": "Miniature overcurrent circuit-breakers shall comply with AS/NZS 3111, AS/NZS 60898.1 or AS/NZS 61009.1, and RCDs shall comply with AS/NZS 61008.1. Each protective device shall be selected such that—\n(a)\tits nominal current or current setting is not less than the design current of the circuit;\n(b)\tits nominal current or current setting does not exceed the lowest current-carrying capacity of any of the conductors in the circuit;\n(c)\tthe overload current causing operation does not exceed 1.45 times the lowest current-carrying capacity of any of the conductors of the circuit; and\n(d)\tthe breaking and making capacity shall be in accordance with the prospective short-circuit or earth fault current at the point at which the device is installed. If the short-circuit breaking or making capacity is less than the protective device it shall be backed up by a fuse or circuit-breaker in accordance with IEC 60092-202.\nCircuit-breakers complying with IEC 60934 may be used in equipment and on switchboards, providing—\n(i)\tthe incoming supply voltage does not exceed 300 V;\n(ii)\tthe incoming supply capacity does not exceed 63 A; and\n(iii)\tincoming supplies are protected at source in each live conductor by a circuit-breaker complying with AS/NZS 3111, AS/NZS 60898.1 or AS/NZS 61009.1."
