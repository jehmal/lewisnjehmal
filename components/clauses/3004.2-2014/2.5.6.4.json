    "title": "Instruments for a.c. generators",
    "fullText": "An a.c. generator not operated in parallel, except single-phase generators smaller than 2 kVA, shall be provided with at least one voltmeter and an ammeter in each phase (or one ammeter with a selector switch which enables it to measure the current in each phase). Generators greater than 15 kVA shall be provided with a frequency meter.\nNOTE: When an a.c. generator is installed a frequency meter should be used.\nGenerators for parallel operation shall be provided with a wattmeter and an ammeter in each phase conductor (or one ammeter with a selector switch to permit the measurement of current in each phase). Wattmeters shall be capable of indicating reverse power up to 15% of the rated full load of the generator. Two voltmeters, two frequency meters and a synchronizing device comprising either a synchroscope and lamps, or an equivalent arrangement, shall be provided for paralleling purposes. One voltmeter and one frequency meter shall be connected to the busbars; the other voltmeter and frequency meter shall have a selector switch to permit measurement of the voltage and frequency of any generator.\nNOTE: When generators are run in parallel in installations with the neutral earthed, it is necessary to ensure that the equalizing current caused by harmonics does not exceed harmful values. Reference is to be made to guidance from the generator manufacturer."
