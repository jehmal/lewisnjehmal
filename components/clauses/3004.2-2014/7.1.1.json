    "fullText": "Metallic enclosures for electrical and electronic equipment shall be connected to the boat's earth via the protective conductor, or connected to the hull of a steel boat, or the electrical equipment enclosed may be constructed in accordance with the principle of double insulation. Each equipotential bond shall be made of copper or another corrosion-resistant material and shall be securely installed and protected against damage and against galvanic corrosion. The nominal cross-sectional area of each equipotential bond conductor shall be not less than one half of the cross-sectional area of the current-carrying conductor to the electrical equipment enclosed, but subject to a minimum of 2.5 mm .\nAccessible non-current-carrying conductive parts adjacent to electrical equipment which could be made inadvertently live shall be bonded to earth either directly or via supplementary bonding conductors to the protective conductor of the electrical equipment or its enclosure or directly to the hull of a steel boat.\nMetals used for earth or equipotential bond terminal studs, nuts and washers shall be corrosion resistant and galvanically compatible with the conductor and terminal. Aluminium and unplated steel shall not be used for studs, nuts or washers in electrical circuits. No more than four conductors shall be secured to one earth or equipotential bond terminal stud.\nEarth connections shall be made to termination points intended only for that purpose."
