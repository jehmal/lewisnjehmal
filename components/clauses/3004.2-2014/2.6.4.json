    "fullText": "Where a boat is supplied from shore power, a galvanic isolator or other suitable device may be fitted in the protective earthing conductor to minimize galvanic current flow while permitting the passage of a.c. current, if present. Galvanic isolators shall be designed and tested to comply with ABYC Standard A-28.\nNOTE: Where galvanic isolators are intended to be used on a 50 Hz shore power supply, the A-28 compliance tests must be carried out with an a.c. test voltage of 230 v at 50 Hz.\nA galvanic isolator shall be designed and manufactured to eitherâ€”\n(a)\tfail to a condition that maintains the a.c. protective earth path between the vessel earth and the shore power earth; or\n(b)\tbe provided with a self-checking system that continuously monitors the galvanic isolator to provide to the vessel operator a visual or audible signal on loss of a.c. earth path continuity.\nNOTE: For guidance, refer to ABYC Standard A-28.\nWhen fitted a galvanic isolator shall be connected into the shore supply protective earthing conductor before it connects to the boat's earth system. It should be installed in an accessible location as close as practical to the shore power inlet."
