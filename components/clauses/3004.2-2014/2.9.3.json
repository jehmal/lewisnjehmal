    "title": "Additional requirements for lithium ion batteries",
    "fullText": "The following additional requirements apply:\n(a)\tLithium ion batteries shall be installed in locations that ensure the battery manufacturer's specified operating temperature limits cannot be exceeded and are appropriate for the IP rating of the battery and its management system.\n(b)\tEach lithium ion battery shall be provided with a battery management safety system (BMS) either integrated into a battery pack or as a separate component located adjacent to the battery. The BMS shall continuously monitor the voltage and temperature of each cell in the battery.\n(c)\tAll charging sources shall be automatically disconnected by the BMS when voltage exceeds the manufacturer's recommended maximum.\n(d)\tAll connected load shall be automatically disconnected by the BMS when the voltage falls below the manufacturer's recommended minimum.\n(e)\tThe battery shall be automatically disconnected by the BMS from all connected load and all charging sources when temperature exceeds the manufacturer's specified maximum.\n(f)\tThe BMS shall provide an audible and visual alarm at the normal vessel operating position before a disconnection event occurs.\n(g)\tLithium ion battery ventilation air flows shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements. If specific air flow data is not provided the requirements of Clauses 2.9.2.2 or 2.9.2.3 shall be applied.\nNOTE: Care must be exercised when disabling charging sources to avoid the risk of elevated voltages that may damage the equipment."
