    "fullText": "An a.c. generator may be driven by its own prime mover or be powered from propulsion machinery, or be a shaft generator. Electrical machines, including shaft generators and/or static converters/inverters, shall comply with the relevant requirements of IEC 60092-301 and IEC 60092-304.\nWhere an a.c. system is provided as a main source of electric power and consists of a single generator, it shall be possible to supply the generator start circuits from an alternative source.\nThe power-feeder conductors from a generator shall be adequate for the thermal capacity of the generator and shall be protected at the generator with overcurrent protection devices in accordance with the requirements of IEC 60092-202.\nThe continuity of supply should not be impaired by load-produced harmonic distortion or high load changes.\nThe combined prime mover, transmission system and generator shall be designed to withstand without damage the effects of the most onerous short-circuit condition at the generator terminals when running at rated voltage and speed.\nWhere synchronization and parallel operation of several generators is required, the requirements of Clause 2.5.4.2 shall apply."
