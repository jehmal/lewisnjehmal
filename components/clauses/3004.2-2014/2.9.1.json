    "fullText": "Batteries shall be secured against movements and inclinations occurring during boat use and shall be covered for protection of battery and battery terminals from loose and falling objects. At inclinations up to 45Â°, electrolyte from vented cells shall not leak. On sailing boats, batteries shall be secured sufficiently to prevent them from breaking free in the event of a complete capsize (i.e. inversion). Lead-acid storage batteries, alkaline and lithium ion storage batteries shall not be placed in a common cabinet or container or in close vicinity to each other.\nAll lead acid and alkaline batteries shall be provided with drip trays or containers which are resistant to the effects of electrolyte. Batteries shall not be installed directly above or below a fuel tank or fuel filter and any other metallic component of the fuel system within 300 mm above the battery top, as installed, shall be electrically insulated."
