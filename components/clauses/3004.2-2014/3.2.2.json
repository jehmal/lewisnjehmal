    "title": "Earthing the neutral conductor in type TN a.c. systems",
    "fullText": "The neutral conductor of an a.c. system shall be earthed eitherâ€”\n(a)\tat the source of power, e.g. at the onboard generator, the secondary of the transformer or the output of an inverter or a converter; or\n(b)\tby a removable link between the vessel main neutral and the main a.c. earth bus bars.\nNOTE: Option (b) is only possible when shore power connects to the vessel via a transformer or converter with isolation between the input and output.\nWhen a vessel is connected directly to shore power the neutral shall only be earthed at the shore power source through the shore power cable.\nEarthed neutral systems shall be designed so that the potential earth fault current will not exceed the design capacity of any part of the system and such current is of sufficient magnitude to operate any protection. Where the neutral point is connected directly to earth, the earth loop impedance should be low enough to permit the passage of current at least three times the fuse rating for fuse protected circuits or 1.5 times the tripping current of any circuit-breaker used to protect the circuit."
