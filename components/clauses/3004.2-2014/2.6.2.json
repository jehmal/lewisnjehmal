    "fullText": "Converters shall be installed so that the circulation of air around them is not impeded and so that the air temperature at their cooling inlet does not exceed the ambient temperature.\nNatural air-cooling units should be designed with sufficient ventilation openings or with sufficient cooling surface to radiate the heat so that totally enclosed equipment will operate within the design temperature limits.\nConverters shall not be mounted near sources of heat such as engine exhaust pipes.\nConverter components shall be so constructed that they can be removed without dismantling the complete unit."
