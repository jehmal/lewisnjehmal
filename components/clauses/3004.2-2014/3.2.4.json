    "title": "Protective conductor in a.c. systems",
    "fullText": "The a.c. protective conductor(s) shall be provided with a final connection to the hull of a metallic hull boat, or, if the boat has a non-metallic hull, to the boat's external main earthing plate. On larger installations a main earth conductor bar may be used to connect all protective conductors at one location before the final connection is made.\nThe protective conductor final connection shall be made at a location above any anticipated water accumulation.\nIn the case of boats of metallic construction, every connection of an equipotential bonding conductor or earthing lead to the boat's structure shall be secured by means of a low resistance conducting metal or other corrosion-resistant material.\nThe interconnection of the earthing lead to the hull should maintain corrosion resistance. Such earthing connection shall not be used for other purposes. The connection shall be located in an accessible position where it may be readily checked.\nEarthing connections of other metals shall have conductance at least equal to that specified for a copper earthing connection.\nThe formation of electrochemical couples with other immersed metallic materials that could cause electrolytic corrosion must be avoided."
