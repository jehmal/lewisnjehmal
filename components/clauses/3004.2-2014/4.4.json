    "fullText": "IT type systems are permissible when continuity of service is requested, otherwise TN systems are acceptable (see Clause 3.2). In IT systems the boat's phase conductor(s) is insulated from earth and the star point either isolated from earth or deliberately connected to earth through a sufficiently high impedance.\nIn IT type systems, it is permissible for a single fault between a live part and an exposed conductive part to occur without automatic disconnection, provided that a continuously operating earth fault or insulation monitoring system, arranged to provide a warning to the vessel operator when an earth fault occurs or insulation value falls below 0.5 MΩ, is fitted. A second fault shall result in automatic disconnection. A prospective touch voltage exceeding 50 V a.c. shall not persist for a time sufficient to cause a risk of harmful physiological effect in a person.\nNOTE: Special arrangements may need to be made for essential services in IT type systems.\nIn IT type systems, the protective arrangements shall be—\n(a)\tan overcurrent protective device; and\n(b)\tan RCD with sensitivity of 30 mA maximum for final subcircuits to locations where there is an increased risk of personnel contact with live conductive parts."
