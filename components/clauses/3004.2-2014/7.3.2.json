    "title": "Cable and conductor runs",
    "fullText": "Cable runs shall be as short and direct as possible, well-supported and protected, and shall be designed to avoid areas of fire risk and areas where there is risk of mechanical damage. Cable penetrations shall not impair the effectiveness of fire protection, watertightness or gastight decks and bulkheads.\nConductors shall be routed away from exhaust pipes and other heat sources which can damage the insulation. The minimum clearance of the conductors is 50 mm from water-cooled exhaust components and 250 mm from dry exhaust components.\nConductor connections shall be in locations protected from the weather or in IP 55 enclosures, in accordance with AS 60529, as a minimum. Connections above deck exposed to intermittent immersion shall be in IP 67 enclosures, in accordance with AS 60529, as a minimum.\nConductors shall be routed above anticipated levels of bilge water and in other areas where water may accumulate, or at least 25 mm above the level at which the automatic bilge-pump switch activates. However, if conductors need to be routed in the bilge area, the conductor, containment and connections shall conform to IP67 in accordance with AS 60529, as a minimum, and there shall be no connection below the foreseeable water level.\nMaterials used for glands and bushings shall be resistant to corrosion, and shall not damage the cable or the boat's structure.\nBending radius shall conform to IEC 60092-352."
