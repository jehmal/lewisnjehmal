    "fullText": "Conductors that are not sheathed shall be supported throughout their length in conduits, cable trunking, or trays, or by individual supports at maximum intervals of 300 mm. Other sheathed conductors shall be supported at maximum intervals of 450 mm.\nEach conductor longer than 300 mm installed separately shall have a cross-section of at least 1 mm . Each conductor in a multi-conductor sheath shall have a minimum cross-section of at least 0.75 mm .\nSheathed conductors and battery conductors to the battery disconnect switch shall be supported at maximum intervals of 300 mm, with the first support not more than 1 m from the terminals.\nConductors that may be exposed to physical damage shall be protected by sheaths, or installed in pipes, conduits, trunking or other equivalent means. Conductors passing through bulkheads or structural members shall be protected against damage to insulation by chafing.\nWith the exception of cables for portable appliances and cables and conductors installed in pipes, conduits, trunking or other equivalent means, cables and conductors shall be fixed by means of clips, saddles or straps of suitable flame-retardant material, and having a surface area sufficiently large and shaped such that the cables or conductors remain located without their coverings becoming damaged."
