    "fullText": "The insulation resistance of generators and motors shall be measured at operating temperature immediately after running at normal load. The embedded temperature sensor of the machine, if any, is connected to earth during testing. A minimum value of 1 ΜΩ shall be obtained. The results obtained depend on the characteristics of the insulation materials and on the way in which they are applied; this information shall be recorded with the test results."
