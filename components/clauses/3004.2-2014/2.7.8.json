    "fullText": "Each switch or control shall be marked to indicate its use, unless the purpose of the switch is obvious and its mistaken operation will not cause a hazardous condition. Switching devices shall be so designed and arranged that when in the 'OFF' position they cannot accidentally move sufficiently to close the circuit.\nSwitches in conductors other than as part of proprietary equipment, shall operate in each active (non-earthed) conductor and shall have voltage and current ratings appropriate for the load(s) being controlled."
