    "fullText": "Cables fitted on decks exposed to the weather, in damp and wet locations (e.g. bathrooms), in refrigerated spaces, in machinery spaces and wherever water condensation or harmful vapours (including oil vapour) may be present, shall have a water resistant sheath.\nNOTE: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), chlorosulphonated-polyethylene (CSP) and polychloroprene (PCP) sheaths are considered as water resistant in this context, although not suitable for permanent immersion in liquids. However, such sheaths should be avoided where they are likely to come into contact with polyurethane or polystyrene insulating materials."
