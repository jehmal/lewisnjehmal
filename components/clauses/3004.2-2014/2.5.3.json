    "fullText": "Where the generator is the only charging source, it shall be capable of supplying the maximum demand of the boat and simultaneously be capable of charging the main battery bank to 80% charge within 10 h.\nWind driven d.c. generators, towed impeller driven generators and photovoltaic systems shall be fitted with charge regulators set so that the battery manufacturer's maximum charging voltage is not exceeded.\nNOTE: These are generally alternators with integral rectifiers and regulators fitted to the propulsion machinery which charge accumulator batteries supplying the boat's electrical equipment and essential services."
