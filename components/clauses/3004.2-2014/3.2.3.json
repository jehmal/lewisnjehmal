    "fullText": "The purpose of the earthing and bonding of non-current-carrying parts of an electrical system is to reduce the danger of shock to personnel and to minimize damage to equipment from the effects of earth currents. These can occur from failures of insulation of live conductors, induced voltages and currents.\nIn metal hulled boats the presence of a large comparative cross-section area of metal for earth return paths enables a simple method of earthing and bonding (TT and IT systems) in which non-current-carrying parts can be directly bonded to the boat's hull. A boat with non-metallic hull shall be provided with a protective conductor [which may be separate from the neutral conductor (TN-S) or (TN-C)].\nExposed metal parts of electrical machines or equipment shall be earthed unless the machine or equipment isâ€”\n(a)\tsupplied at safety voltage;\n(b)\tsupplied at a voltage not exceeding 230 V nominal by an isolating transformer supplying only one consuming device; and\n(c)\tconstructed in accordance with the principle of double insulation (see Clause 4.5).\nWhere an a.c. protective conductor connects to the case of a device that is also connected to an earthed negative d.c. system, e.g. a battery charger or an inverter, the case of the device shall be connected to the d.c. negative by a separate conductor with the same current capacity as the d.c. positive conductor."
