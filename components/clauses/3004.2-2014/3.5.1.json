    "fullText": "Where a boat requires connection of an a.c. supply from shore, a suitable shore supply inlet arrangement rated at IP56 shall be installed on the boat for the connection of the flexible cable(s) to the shore supply socket-outlet. The IP56 rating shall be achieved while the boat is connected or disconnected. For boats which are fitted with a.c. generation supplying on-board systems, except where permitted by Clause 2.5.4, an interlocked changeover switch shall prevent parallel connection between the shore power supply and the on-board generation. The changeover switch shall be of a type suitable for isolation and shall include all phases and neutral.\nOnly one boat shall be connected at any one time to a single shore supply socket-outlet.\nWhere boats have facilities for the connection of more than one supply lead (i.e. appliance inlets or direct connection points), connections on-board the boat shall be arranged such that there are no interconnections between the live (active and neutral) conductors or pins of different inlets or direct connection points, or both.\nNOTE: IP rating for shore supply socket-outlet should be according to Table 3 and should be maintained irrespective of the location of the plug."
