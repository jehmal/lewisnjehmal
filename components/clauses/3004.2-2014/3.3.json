    "title": "EQUIPOTENTIAL BONDING CONDUCTORS",
    "fullText": "In d.c. and a.c. systems the equipotential bonding should be such as to give substantially equal potential and sufficiently low earth fault loop impedance to ensure correct operation of protective devices. Extraneous conductive parts that are connected to the hull of a steel boat by permanent and reliable metal to metal joints of negligible impedance need not be bonded by separate earthing conductors.\nEvery earthing conductor shall be of copper or other corrosion-resistant material and shall, where necessary, be securely installed and protected against damage and electrolytic corrosion.\nThe bonding conductor may be insulated. The colour of the insulation for d.c. and a.c. installations shall be green or green and yellow stripes. This colour combination shall not be used for current-carrying conductors."
