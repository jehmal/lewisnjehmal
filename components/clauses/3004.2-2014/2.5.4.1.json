    "fullText": "Power may be provided by one or a combination of the following to supply the maximum demand of the boat:\n(a)\tOne or more shore power connections per boat, and associated power inlets, wiring and components with a capacity to supply the maximum demand of the boat.\n(b)\tInverter supplying a.c. power from the boat's d.c. system.\n(c)\tOn-board a.c. generator(s) supplying the required system load.\n(d)\tCombination of shore power connection(s) and on-board generator(s) used simultaneously if the boat's circuitry is arranged such that the load connected to each source is isolated from the other or supplies are combined in accordance with Clause 2.5.4.2 [from ISO 13297:2012 Cl.14.1(e)].\nIndividual circuits shall not be capable of being energized by more than one source of electrical power at a time except as provided in Clause 2.5.4.2. Two or more generators, when properly synchronized, shall be treated as one source. Each shore power inlet, generator or inverter shall be considered a separate source of a.c. electrical power. The transfer from one power source circuit to another shall be made by a means which opens all current-carrying conductors before closing the other source circuit, prevents arc-over between contacts and is interlocked by mechanical or electromechanical means. All current-carrying conductors shall be broken simultaneously when changing power sources."
