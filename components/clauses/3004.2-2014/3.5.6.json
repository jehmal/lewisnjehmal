    "fullText": "Where the electrical installation on the boat is intended to be supplied via an on-board isolating transformer, the transformer shall comply with AS/NZS 61558.\nConverters shall provide isolation between input and output equivalent to an isolating transformer.\nThe following items shall be connected effectively to an equipotential bonding conductor which, in turn, shall be connected to one of the secondary winding terminals of the isolating transformer:\n(a)\tConductive parts of the boat in electrical contact with the water. There shall be more than one connection point if the boat's construction does not ensure continuity between conductive parts.\nNOTE: The above requirement does not apply to conductive parts which are mounted on insulating material or which are insulated from other conductive parts.\n(b)\tThe earthing contact of all socket-outlets.\n(c)\tThe exposed conductive parts of equipment that are required to be earthed in accordance with AS/NZS 3000.\nNo connection should be made between the bonding of the boat and the protective earthing conductor of the marina low voltage electrical supply.\nNOTE: Where the boat's earth is connected to the shore power protective earth, a galvanic isolator that complies with Clause 2.6.4 should be installed."
