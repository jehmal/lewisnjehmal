    "fullText": "Insulation resistance should be measured by self-contained instruments such as a direct-reading ohmmeter of the generator type, applying a voltage of at least 500 V. The test voltage for systems rated less than 230 V should be limited to twice the rated voltage of the equipment being tested.\nNOTE: Care should be taken on electronic equipment to ensure that no damage is sustained due to the application of test voltages."
