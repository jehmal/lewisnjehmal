    "fullText": "After the electrical installation has been completed and before the boat is placed in commission, the entire electrical installation shall be verified by inspection and testing in accordance with AS/NZS 3000. Such tests are intended to indicate the general condition of the installation at the time of completion; however, satisfactory test results do not in themselves necessarily ensure that the installation is satisfactory in all respects. Appendix C provides guidance on periodic verification.\nNOTE: The test methods described by AS/NZS 3000 and AS/NZS 3017 will in some instances need to be adapted to effectively test a boat's electrical installation.\nAll the switches and isolators necessary for the safe use of the installation and for the safe performance of control and electrical work shall be present during testing.\nA record of the tests and inspections carried out shall be made in accordance with Appendix C.\nIn New Zealand, a Warrant of Electrical Fitness (WoEF) shall only be issued for a boat that has been inspected and tested in accordance with Appendix C. The WoEF shall be certified on an appropriate form. See Appendix D."
