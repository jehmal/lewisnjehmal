    "fullText": "Batteries shall be protected against overload and short-circuit by means of fuses or circuit-breakers at a position adjacent to the battery compartment. Overcurrent protection may be omitted for the circuit to the starter motors when the current drawn is so large that it is impracticable to obtain short-circuit protection.\nA fuse or circuit-breaker shall, as a minimum, be installed in each unearthed pole of each circuit connected directly to a battery within 200 mm of the battery terminals.\nIf this is impractical, the fuse or circuit-breaker may be placed up to 1.8 m from the terminals provided each conductor from the battery is contained within a protective covering, such as a sheathing conduit or cable trunking, for its entire length from the battery terminal to the circuit protective device.\nThere shall be not more than four conductors connected to a single battery terminal."
