  "fullText": "Switchboard wiring shall be designed and installed to withstand any thermal and magnetic effects on the conductors. Where provision is made to hinge or remove switchboard panels, all conductors connected to electrical equipment on the switchboard panel shall be: (a) provided with sufficient free length to allow the panel to be moved into a position to enable work to be carried out; (b) suitably fixed or otherwise retained in position to avoid undue movement or stress at terminals of electrical equipment when the panel is moved or is fixed in position; and (c) arranged to prevent undue pressure on electrical equipment mounted behind the panel."
