    "fullText": "Equipment in which protection against electric shock does not rely on basic insulation only, but that includes an additional level of protection, in that conductive accessible parts are connected to the protective earthing conductor in the fixed wiring of the installation in such a way that those accessible parts cannot become live in the event of a failure of the basic insulation.\nNOTE â€“\n(1)\tClass I equipment may have parts with double insulation, reinforced insulation or parts operating at safety extra-low voltage.\n(2)\tThis provision includes a protective earthing conductor as part of the flexible cord or flexible cable for equipment intended for use with a flexible cord or flexible cable.\n(3)\tOther classes are described in AS/NZS 60335.1."
