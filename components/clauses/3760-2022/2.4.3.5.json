    "title": "Polarity of rewireable non-reversible connectors, rewireable plugs and rewireable cord extension sockets",
    "fullText": "The correct polarity of the individual wires in rewireable non-reversible connectors, rewireable plugs and rewireable cord extension sockets is shown in (a) (b) and (c) below, and additional details of older and international schemes are provided in Appendix C. The indicative frequency of test is provided in column (b) of Table 2.4.\na)\tConnectors\nThe order (polarity) of the contact positions in rewireable non-reversible connectors, when looking at the engagement face of the connectors their disposition shall be as follows:\n•\tEarthing contact (if any): upper central position (green/yellow wire);\n•\tActive (line) contact: lower right-hand position (brown wire);\n•\tNeutral contact: lower left-hand position (blue wire).\nNOTE – See Figure C.1\nb)\tPlugs\nThe order (polarity) of the pins of a three pin flat pin plug, to their connections, shall be\n•\tEarth (radial pin – green/yellow wire);\n•\tNeutral (blue wire);\n•\tActive (brown wire);\nin a clockwise direction, when viewed from the front of the plug looking at the pins.\nNOTE – See Figure C.2\nc)\tCord extension sockets\nThe order (polarity) of the socket apertures of a three pin flat pin socket, to their connections, shall be\n•\tEarth (radial pin aperture – green/yellow wire);\n•\tActive (brown wire);\n•\tNeutral (blue wire);\nin a clockwise direction, when viewed from the front of the socket looking at the apertures.\nNOTE – See Figure C.2"
