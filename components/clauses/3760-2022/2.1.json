    "fullText": "Experience has shown that more than 90 % of defects are detectable by visual inspection. Therefore, equipment shall be visually inspected, physically checked and tested in accordance with this section.\nThe frequency of repetition of that process is determined by the equipment type and by examination of the environment in which the equipment is used or working.\nFor indicative purposes, a number of environments are shown in column (a) of Table 2.4. These are based on the perception of the level of hazard and the degree of abuse that the equipment is typically exposed.\nHowever, there will usually be multiple sub-environments within any location and the inspecting/ testing frequency will be arrived at by a risk assessment by the responsible person, of the actual environment in which the equipment is placed or used.\nNOTE â€“ For equipment that is supplied by a cord set, both the cord set and equipment need to be tested and tagged separately."
