Accordingly, the testing of such equipment is not required by this standard;\n\nb)\tWhere the flexible cable or flexible cord is flexed on equipment that is moved only, for example, for restocking, maintenance or cleaning, in-service testing is required. For such fixed equipment or stationary equipment, it is sufficient, for the purposes of this standard, to do a visual inspection and earth test only since insulation testing requires disconnection. For carrying out the earth test on such equipment additional knowledge and processes are required.\n\nFigure 4.7 from AS/NZS 3000 showing equipment connected to the installation wiring by equipment wiring"
