    "fullText": "Electrical equipment shall be inspected and tested:\na)\tAt intervals indicated in Table 2.4 (subject to a tolerance of two weeks), or as varied by a\nresponsible person based on a risk assessment;\nNOTE –\n(1)\tRegulatory authorities, other Standards, workplace safety requirements or manufacturers' instructions may specify shorter or longer intervals appropriate to particular industries or specific types of equipment.\n(2)\tSome regulatory jurisdictions limit the inspection and testing of electrical equipment to defined work activity or working environments. For example, construction work or equipment used in a hostile operating environment.\nb)\tOn return to service after a repair or servicing that could have affected the electrical safety of the equipment, AS/NZS 5762 may apply;\nc)\tBefore placement in service, if sourced from a second-hand sale, to ensure the equipment is safe, AS/NZS 5761 shall apply.\nd)\tTo allow the flexibility to devise a customized solution for particular circumstances, organizations with sufficient expertise and resource may substitute other periods than those indicated in Table 2.4, after conducting a documented risk assessment undertaken in accordance with the process specified in AS/NZS ISO 31000 and taking into consideration any relevant legislative requirements or guidelines.\nThis risk assessment option does not apply to equipment offered for hire.\nNOTE – This exclusion has been made as the hirer has no control over the end use of the equipment and therefore a valid risk assessment cannot be conducted by the hirer."
