This equipment is generally manufactured with a non-conductive (insulated) enclosure,\nand is marked either with the words 'Class II', 'DOUBLE INSULATED' or with the symbol    to allow easy identification.\nNOTE â€“\n(1)\tClass II equipment may also be manufactured with a metal enclosure that is double insulated from live parts.\n(2)\tClass II equipment may be provided with an earth connection for purposes other than safety. This earth connection is referred to as a functional earth (FE). Functionally earthed parts are double insulated from live parts."
