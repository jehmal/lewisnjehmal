    "fullText": "This standard specifies procedures for the safety inspection and testing of low voltage single phase and polyphase electrical equipment, connected to an electrical supply by a flexible cord or connecting device, and that:\n-\tIs new equipment placed into service for the first time;\n-\tIs already in-service;\n-\tHas been serviced or repaired;\n-\tIs returning to service from a second-hand sale; or\n-\tIs available for hire.\nThis standard also specifies procedures for the safety inspection and testing of:\n-\tIn Australia, residual current devices (RCDs) installed in the electrical installation;\n-\tPortable inverters that generate or produce low voltage. Typical examples of equipment covered by this standard are:\n-\tPortable equipment, hand-held equipment and stationary equipment, designed for connection to the low voltage supply by a supply cord, an appliance inlet or pins for insertion into a socket-outlet;\n-\tCord sets, cord extension sets and portable outlet devices;\n-\tPortable residual current devices (PRCD), outgoing assemblies for construction sites (ACS); portable socket-outlet assemblies (PSOA), outlet boxes;\n-\tFlexible cords connected to fixed equipment in hostile environments;\n-\tPortable power supplies (includes power adaptor/plug-pack, both of the safety isolating transformer and switch-mode type);\n-\tBattery chargers, including those for commercial or industrial use;\n-\tPortable and transportable heavy duty tools such as high-pressure washers and concrete grinders."
