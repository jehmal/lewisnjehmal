  "fullText": "Where electrical equipment is filled with a liquid dielectric having a flashpoint not exceeding 250°C and has a total liquid capacity exceeding 50 L in any unit or group of adjacent units, precautions shall be taken to prevent the spread of fire.\nSuch precautions may include the provision of enclosures consisting of fire- resisting dykes, bunds, curbed areas, basins, trenches filled with coarse crushed stone or, where necessary, trapped drains.\nNOTES:\n1\tExamples of such precautions are—\n(a)\ta drainage pit to collect leakages of liquid and ensure their extinction in the event of fire; or\n(b)\tinstallation of the electrical equipment in a chamber of adequate fire- resistance and the provision of sills or other means of preventing burning liquid spreading to other parts of the premises, such chamber being ventilated solely to the external atmosphere.\n2\tFor less than 50 L, it is generally sufficient to take precautions to prevent the escape of liquid.\n3\tIt may be desirable to switch off the supply to the electrical equipment automatically at the onset of a fire."
