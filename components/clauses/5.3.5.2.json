  "fullText": "The MEN connection should be a conductor complying with Clause 5.3.2 and have a cross-sectional area capable of carrying the maximum current that it may be required to carry under short-circuit conditions.\n\nThe minimum size shall be:\n(a) Not less than the current-carrying capacity of the main neutral conductor; or\n(b) For switchboards described in Clause 2.5.5 as rated at 800 A or more per phase, as determined for a protective earthing conductor from Table 5.1 or by calculation.\n\nExceptions: The minimum size of the MEN connection need not exceed that of the main earthing conductor in the following circumstances:\n1. Where short-circuit protection is provided on the supply side of the consumer mains.\n2. Where the earthing of an enclosure containing consumer mains not provided with short-circuit protection on the supply side is made by connection directly to the neutral bar in accordance with Clause 5.5.3.5.\n3. Where double insulation of the consumer mains conductors is maintained up to the supply terminals of the service protective devices, and short-circuit protection is provided by such devices.\n\nNote: An electricity distributor's upstream service protective device may provide short-circuit protection of consumer mains.",
