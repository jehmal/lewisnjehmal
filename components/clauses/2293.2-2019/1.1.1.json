    "fullText": "This Standard sets out the requirements for connectable electrical installations used for the purposes of accommodation, habitation or other residential, commercial or recreational uses that are intended for connection to external low voltage a.c. (see Clause 1.4.28) supply systems by either â€”\n(a) a detachable supply lead; or\n(b) a supply lead directly connected to the connectable electrical installation.\nA connectable electrical installation (see Clause 1.4.8) may comprise a number of types of low voltage supplies, however where a connectable electrical installation has the facility to connect to an external supply (see Clause 1.4.23.2), it is required to comply with this Standard.\nThis Standard also sets out requirements and provides guidance for the installation of extra-low voltage (see Clause 1.4.28) systems installed within connectable electrical installations that are intended for detachable connection to external low voltage a.c. supply systems.\nFor the purposes of this Standard, the term \"connectable electrical installation\" includes vehicles and units with or without wheels that can readily be moved from one site to another, either under their own motive power or by some other means.\nThe particular requirements of this Standard replace, modify or are additional to the general requirements of AS/NZS 3000 for the electrical wiring of connectable electrical installations.\nThese requirements are intended to protect persons, livestock, and property from electric shock, fire and physical injury hazards that may arise from a connectable electrical installation that is used with reasonable care and with due regard to the intended purpose of the electrical installation.\nIn addition, guidance is provided so that the electrical installation functions correctly for the purpose intended."
