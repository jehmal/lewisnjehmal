    "fullText": "The procedures specified in Table A4 (rows 4.14 and 4.15), where no manufacturer's declared LSL exists, and Table A6, where a manufacturer's declared LSL exists, shall be carried out when required to check the light source life (LSL) of maintained LED luminaires and exit signs. The service frequency and tolerance interval to be applied is shown in Appendix A. Any changes and all results shall be recorded.\nThe manufacturer's declared LSL applies to maintained emergency luminaires and maintained exit signs only and is assigned in accordance with the LSL requirements for LED exit signs detailed in AS/NZS 2293.3.\nWhere no manufacturer's declared LSL exists, the relevant tests and conformance conditions of Table A6 apply 12 months from commissioning of the installation.\nWhere the manufacturer's declared LSL is specified, the ongoing performance of installed maintained LED luminaires and exit signs shall be assessed at the next service interval.\n\nFor maintained LED luminaires and exit signs, at the end of the LSL eitherâ€”\n(a)\tthe luminaire/exit sign or light source shall be replaced; or\n(b)\tthe ongoing performance of the installed LED luminaire or exit sign shall be checked to ensure the ongoing viability of the luminaire or exit sign.\nTo check the ongoing LSL viability, a representative number of LED luminaire exit sign samples shall be taken from the site and their performance measured (see Clause 3.5.2.4). The results are intended to confirm if the installed luminaires or exit signs will continue to provide not less than the minimum requirements for these luminaire or exit sign types and that they are suitable for ongoing service for a period of time into the future."
