    "fullText": "A number of maintained emergency luminaires or exit signs shall be collected and tested as follows:\n(a)\tThe number of test samples required shall be determined from the number of the same or compatible type and vintage of luminaire or exit signs installed, whereâ€”\n(i)\tone sample if <100 are installed; or\n(ii)\ttwo samples if <500; otherwise\n(iii)\tthree or more samples.\nNOTE: There may be many types of luminaires in an installation. The intent is for a service person to assess the need for each type to be tested. Any increase in the number of types that may be included in a single test (to reduce test load) necessitates a risk assessment and the rationale should be recorded. Factors that affect LSL include LED chip, control gear settings and operation temperature.\n(b)\tSelect and replace the visually representative sample(s), i.e. dullest or with lowest apparent brightness.\n(c)\tSubject samples to the following tests:\n(i)\tFor maintained LED luminaires, determine the illuminance and classification in accordance with the requirements for the procedure for deriving the luminaire classification detailed in AS/NZS 2293.3, except for self-contained emergency luminaires, in which case, replace the d.c. power supply and use the fully charged battery supplied with the luminaire for the test.\n(ii)\tFor maintained LED signs, determine the minimum face luminance in accordance with AS/NZS 2293.3.\nNOTE: Only the minimum C0 value is required."
