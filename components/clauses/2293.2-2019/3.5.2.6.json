    "title": "Exit sign conformance",
    "fullText": "All test samples shall achieve the minimum luminance requirements set out in this Clause.\nWhere LED exit signs are measured in accordance with the procedure in Clause 3.5.2.4, the minimum luminance shall be greater than 10 cd/m2. Signs that meet this requirement are deemed to be suitable for a further five years before re-assessment of this criteria is required.\nFor LED exit signs, the method to determine the light source life is detailed in AS/NZS 2293.3 in accordance with the requirements for projection of light source life (LSL) in LED exit signs.\nNOTES:\n1\tThe minimum luminance of an exit sign is 8 cd/m2. For an LED exit sign this minimum should be based on the end of rated lumen maintenance life. If a manufacturer provides an exit sign with a significantly higher luminance the Lxx value may also be shown, i.e. L50.\n2\tThe in-situ temperature assessment is shown in IES LM-84 Annex A.\n3\tA service person may use these test results as evidence of the likely ongoing performance and viability of the installed signs. If the sign is of a known age and the results are above the minimum requirements, they could continue to comply with the minimum requirements for what could conceivably be up to five years into the future. This is especially true if the exit sign data can be compared to the manufacturer's original report or data provided as baseline data."
