    "fullText": "Prior to commencing any routine service, the following precautions shall be taken:\n(a)\tDetermine the risk and ensure all reasonable precautions will be taken to not adversely affect the normal operation of any system, except for those systems to be serviced, or to adversely affect safety of the building occupants.\n(b)\tInform the responsible entityâ€”\n(i)\tthat a routine service is to be carried out, which may adversely affect the occupants or operations of the building;\n(ii)\tof the extent and expected duration of the impairment during the routine service and maintenance so that alternative safety arrangements can be implemented; and\n(iii)\tthat part of the building may be without emergency lighting when a discharge test of the emergency luminaires and exit signs is undertaken.\nNOTE: When selecting a time for the discharge test, the nature of the occupancy of the building should be considered. Risk mitigation may include undertaking a discharge test of tenanted floors during daylight and fire stairs after hours or conducting the test discharge at a time that will permit recharging of the battery when the building is unoccupied.\n(c)\tEnsure that no interruption to the normal supply has taken place for a period of at least 16 h prior to conducting a discharge test of the emergency luminaires and exit signs.\nOn completion of any routine service and maintenance, all controls shall be returned to their prior state. Any function left impaired, disabled or not restored to 'normal', shall be recorded in the service and maintenance records."
