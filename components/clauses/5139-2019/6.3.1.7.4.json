  "title": "EARTH CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS â€” RESISTIVE EARTHED",
  "fullText": "A resistive earthed battery system is a battery system, with a resistor inserted in series with the earth connection, connected to a PCE providing separation from an earth referenced system, e.g. the grid, (see Figure 6.7).\nFor resistively earthed battery system, one conductor of the battery system shall be connected to the installation earthing system via a resistor (see Figures 6.9 to 6.14). The battery system earthing conductor shall be rated to withstand the prospective earth fault current of the battery system continuously.\nNOTE In a resistively earthed system the prospective earth fault current is significantly reduced by the use of the resistor and may not trip the overcurrent protection."
