  "title": "ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BATTERY SYSTEM ENCLOSURES",
  "fullText": "In addition to the enclosure requirements specified in Clause 6.2.5, battery system enclosures shall meet the following requirements for battery systems categorized as explosive gas hazards in Table 3.1:\n(a) The design of the enclosure shall prevent the formation of gas pockets.\n(b) The enclosure shall meet ventilation requirements for the particular battery types specified by Clauses 6.3.5.2.\n(c) No equipment, which could cause a spark or arc shall be installed above the battery or battery modules inside the enclosure.\n(d) The enclosure's doors, access panels and cable entry glands between the battery system and any other part of the BESS shall seal in a manner that ensures air flows from inlet to outlet vents across the battery system, and not by other unsealed apertures.\n(e) Battery system overcurrent protection devices and battery system isolation devices shall be mounted outside the battery system enclosure, but as close as practicable to the battery system enclosure (to minimize cable length).\n(f) Socket outlets shall not be installed within the enclosure.\nWhere a purpose-built equipment enclosure is installed above a purpose-built battery system enclosure the following shall be met:\n(i) A gas proof barrier shall be between the battery system enclosure and the equipment enclosure.\n(ii) The ventilation paths for the battery system enclosure and the equipment enclosure shall be specifically designed to eliminate the possibility of air having been exhausted from the battery system enclosure entering the air inlets of the equipment enclosure.\nNOTE 1 See Appendix D, Figure D.3.\nThe purpose-built equipment enclosure should be ventilated using natural ventilation (i.e. without the use of an electrically powered fan).\nNOTE 2 Typical combined battery and inverter or electronic equipment enclosures are shown in Appendix D."
