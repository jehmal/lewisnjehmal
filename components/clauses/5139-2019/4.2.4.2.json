  "title": "BARRIER TO HABITABLE ROOMS",
  "fullText": "For the purposes of this Clause, a surface or barrier material is considered suitably non-combustible if the material is deemed to be not combustible when tested in accordance with AS 1530.1. Materials exempt from the need to be tested to AS 1530.1 and considered to be suitably non-combustible are —\n(a) brick or masonry block;\n(b) concrete;\n(c) compressed cement sheeting; and\n(d) ceramic or terracotta tiles.\nThe material shall have no vents or perforations within the zone required to be covered by the barrier.\nAny penetration of the barrier that has an internal free space greater than 5 mm diameter shall be sealed with a fire retardant sealant.\nTo protect against the spread of fire to habitable rooms, where the pre-assembled integrated BESS is mounted on or placed against or near a surface of a wall or structure that has a habitable room on the other side, the wall or structure shall be a suitably non-combustible barrier. If the mounting or nearby surface itself is not made of a suitably non-combustible material, a non-combustible barrier shall be placed between the pre-assembled integrated BESS and the surface of a wall or structure.\nWhere the pre-assembled integrated BESS is located on the wall, or mounted on the floor within 300 mm of the wall or structure separating it from the habitable room, the barrier shall extend —\n(i) 600 mm beyond the vertical sides of the BESS;\n(ii) 900 mm above the BESS; and\n(iii) to the extent of the bottom of the BESS.\nNOTE See Figure 4.2 and Appendix E for typical layout examples.\nWhere the top of the pre-assembled integrated BESS is within 900 mm of the ceiling or structure above the BESS, the ceiling or structure surface shall be suitably non-combustible for an area of 600 mm past the extremities of the BESS."
