  "fullText": "Any commissioning requirements of the manufacturer shall be followed. For some battery types specific instruction on initial charging and discharging is provided.\nSystem commissioning shall include verification that the system as a whole operates and, in particular, the battery system operates in both charge and discharge modes.\nAt installation commissioning, all d.c. connections shall be tested while the system is operating at minimum 50 % charge or discharge current to identify any high resistance connections . For example, voltage measurement across terminals, temperature measurement or infrared imaging of connections or terminals.\nOperational parameters that are configured at installation for the control of the battery system shall be verified (whether this is done through the PCE directly or through a data connection or host computer connection). Remote monitoring where included with the battery system should be configured so access is available to the system owner or nominated representative.\nThe system shutdown procedure shall be tested to ensure this results in safe shutdown of the installation."
