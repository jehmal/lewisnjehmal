  "title": "PRE-ASSEMBLED INTEGRATED BESS ROOM REQUIREMENTS",
  "fullText": "Where pre-assembled integrated BESS are installed within a room, they shall be located so that access to the BESSs are not obstructed by the structure of the building, fixtures and fittings within the room.\nThe room should be clean, dry and ventilated and provide and maintain protection against detrimental environmental conditions and other external factors. In addition the room should be selected to minimize likelihood of a build up of other materials around or on the BESS, or an infestation of insect or vermin, or similar issues occurring that may cause a hazard.\nThe size of the room shall allow for sufficient clearance around the pre-assembled integrated BESS to provide safe handling and access for installation, removal and maintenance.\nThe pre-assembled integrated BESS minimum unimpeded access on the working side of a system shall be no less than 600 mm or the clearance specified by the manufacturer, whichever is greater. Where access panels allow access to 230 V a.c. connections, the minimum clearance shall be 900 mm."
