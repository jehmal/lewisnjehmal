  "fullText": "Where the battery type is a flooded lead acid battery the charging rate (I) used in the ventilation equation shall be the maximum combined output rating of the charger(s) or the rating of the battery system overcurrent protection device, whichever is the lesser.\nWhere the battery type is a sealed valve-regulated lead acid battery the charging rate (I) used in the ventilation equation is determined for two conditions, as follows:\n(a) Condition I — If the PCE(s) acting as a charger does not have an automatic over voltage cutoff, the charging current is the maximum output rating of the charger or the rating of the overcurrent protection device of the charger, whichever is the lesser.\n(b) Condition II — If the PCE(s) acting as a charger has an automatic over voltage cut-off set at the battery manufacturer's specified level, the charging rate is 0.5 A per 100 A.h. at the 3 h rate of discharge of battery capacity.\nNOTE 1 These charging rates are based on a float voltage of 2.27 V per cell and have been selected to provide a safe level of ventilation for all types of battery construction.\nWhere the battery type is nickel cadmium battery, the charging rate (I) used in the ventilation equation is 1.5 A per 100 A.h. at the 3 h rate of discharge of battery capacity.\nNOTE 2 These charging rates are based on a float voltage of 1.45 V per cell and has been selected to provide a safe level of ventilation for all types of battery construction."
