  "title": "IP RATING",
  "fullText": "A battery system or BESS installation shall have protection against ingress of solid foreign objects and against ingress of water. Equipment shall have an IP code rating as specified in IEC 60529 for the environment in which it is to be installed.\nFor battery systems, the battery terminals and other connected live parts shall have minimum protection of IP2X.\nFor battery systems installed outdoors, the enclosure of the battery system shall provide minimum protection of IP23 for the battery system terminals and other connected conductive parts. Higher IP rating protection may be required depending on the installation location and the battery system type.\nNOTE 1 The installation of battery system and BESS enclosures indoors may have other restrictions based on their identified hazards.\nNOTE 2 IP23 is the minimum and AS/NZS 3000 may require higher rating depending on location. For example, due to the environment not being fully sealed from the effects of weather, or having water or other liquid storage system in the same location, or being in the vicinity of areas where use of a hose or washing activity of any kind may occur, or having water taps or the like."
