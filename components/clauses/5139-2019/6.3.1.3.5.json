  "title": "ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR A DISCONNECTION DEVICE INTEGRATED INTO PCE",
  "fullText": "The PCE may include an internal isolation device that meets one of the following additional requirements:\n(a) An isolation device that is mechanically interlocked with a replaceable module of the PCE, and allows the module to be removed from the section containing the isolation device without risk of electrical hazards.\n(b) An isolation device located in the same enclosure as other components of the PCE. With the isolation device in the off position there shall be no risk of electrical hazard when any PCE external enclosure cover is removed for repair or replacement of other components of the PCE. This ensures there is separate screening from touch of live parts of the battery side of the isolation device, including terminals and connection (that are within the same enclosure as other components of the PCE) when the external cover is removed. Action to prevent risk of electrical hazard when removing parts may include use of disconnection of any connectors internal to the PCE, if those connectors have shielding to prevent access to their live parts.\nNOTE PCE manufacturer's instructions to disconnect any external d.c. plug/socket on the external enclosure of the PCE should not be considered to meet the requirement of separate screening of the battery side of the isolation device live parts, terminals and connections."
