  "title": "TYPE OF CABLE",
  "fullText": "Battery system cables shall be flexible cables in accordance with —\n(a) AS/NZS 5000.2 (450/750 V insulation) for battery systems with a maximum operating voltage less than 450 V d.c.;\n(b) AS/NZS 5000.1 (0.6/1 kV insulation) for battery systems with a maximum operating voltage less than 600 V d.c.; or\n(c) IEC 62930 for battery systems with a maximum operating voltage less than 1500 V d.c.\nNOTE IEC 62930 is for photovoltaic systems, however, it covers cables sizes up to 400 mm2 and 1500 V d.c. rating and is suitable for battery systems.\nWiring between the battery system and the PCE shall meet the requirements of AS/NZS 3000 for selection and installation of wiring systems.\nThe cable from the battery system to the PCE shall be —\n(i) double insulated if the battery system's maximum voltage exceeds DVC-A; and\n(ii) double insulated for DVC-A battery system connected to a non-separated PCE (e.g. solar charge controller) and where non-battery side of the PCE is greater than DVC-A.\nThe cable between the battery system, the overcurrent protection device and the PCE should be double insulated for all battery systems operating at DVC-A."
