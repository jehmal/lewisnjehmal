Inlets should be no higher than the tops of the individual batteries or battery modules, and, where required, fitted with a screen to prevent the entry of vermin.\n(C) To avoid stratification of the airflow, ventilation inlets and outlets should consist of —\n(1) a number of holes spaced evenly along the side of the room or enclosure; or\n(2) a slot running along the side of the room or enclosure.\nNOTE 2 Appendix D provides examples of battery system enclosures."
