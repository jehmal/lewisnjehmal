DC wiring shall not be installed or pass through a.c. switchboards or enclosures unless segregated by means of an insulating barrier, such as conduit or trunking.\nWhere devices such as switches for circuits requiring segregation are mounted on a common mounting rail in an enclosure, this rail shall not be metallic or conductive unless the entire enclosure is metallic."
