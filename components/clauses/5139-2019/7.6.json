  "fullText": "A sign stating voltage and current shall be mounted either adjacent to the enclosure or on all doors to the battery system or BESS room.\nThis sign shall state the following:\n(a) The words \"Battery System\" or \"Battery Energy Storage System\".\n(b) Short-circuit current (specify current in amperes).\n(c) Maximum d.c. voltage (specify voltage in volts).\nFor systems over DVC-A, the above signage requirements apply plus an additional line shall be added to the sign stating \"Hazardous d.c. voltage\".\nWhere multiple battery systems or BESS are installed the following apply:\n(i) Only one sign is required if the battery systems are all in the same room/enclosure.\n(ii) The voltage specified shall be the maximum voltage present.\n(iii) The current shall be maximum short-circuit current calculated for any of the BESS, where for each BESS that has multiple battery systems connected in parallel, the calculated current shall be the sum of the battery system short-circuit currents of each of the paralleled battery systems.\nWhere multiple BESS are installed within one electrical installation, there shall be a sign for each BESS that includes an identifiable number together with the total number of BESS shown. For example, BESS 1 of (insert total number of BESS), BESS 2 of (insert total number of BESSs)."
