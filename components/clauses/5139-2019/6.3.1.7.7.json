  "title": "SIZE OF EARTH CABLE",
  "fullText": "The earth cable in an earthed battery system shall be sized according to AS/NZS 3000:2018 Clause 5.3.3.1.2. This relates to the cable cross-sectional area being required to be determined either —\n(a) from AS/NZS 3000:2018 Table 5.1 in relation to the cross-sectional area of the largest active conductor supplying the portion of the electrical installation to be protected; or\n(b) by calculation in accordance with AS/NZS 3000:2018 Clause 5.3.3.1.3.\nWhen the BESS is earthed at the battery system or PCE, the earth cable size shall be calculated according to Item (b) to carry the maximum earth fault current for a time at least equal to the operating time of the associated overcurrent protective device.\nNOTE 1 In the event of unintentional contact of an earth conductor to unearthed (live) parts, the fault current can be significant.\nIf the BESS comprises multiple parallel battery systems and if there is only one battery system cable connected to the PCE, the \"nominal size of earth conductor\" shall be sized to carry —\n(i) the maximum earth fault current for a time at least equal to the operating time of the associated overcurrent protective device for that cable (see Figure 6.12); or\n(ii) the sum of the maximum earth fault currents for a time at least equal to the operating time of the associated overcurrent protective device for the individual battery cable (refer to AS/NZS 3000:2018 Section 5) or the sum of the individual battery system battery cables (see Figure 6.10).\nNOTE 2 If there is no single fuse protecting the single cable then Item (ii) applies."
