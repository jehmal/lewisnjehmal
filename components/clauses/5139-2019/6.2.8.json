  "title": "SEISMIC (EARTHQUAKE) FORCES",
  "fullText": "Depending on location/application, the battery system enclosure, BESS and/or battery system stand(s) may need to be designed and installed to withstand seismic (earthquake) forces, given the combined weight of the battery, inverter or other equipment associated with the BESS and mounted in the enclosure or on the stand.\nFor Australia, where the battery system or BESS is installed in, or on, a building that is required to be designed for earthquake action, the earthquake action requirements for the battery system or BESS shall be in accordance with AS 1170.4.\nFor New Zealand, where a higher level of seismic restraint is required, the battery system or BESS seismic (earthquake) restraint shall be in accordance with NZS 4219.\nUse of multi-tier battery system stands or enclosures increases the seismic restraint requirements for the upper tier(s) of batteries or battery modules, and in turn, increases the size of the vertical components and diagonal parts of the battery stand.\nFor battery system or BESS installations, the designer or installer should seek advice from a structural engineer or similar."
