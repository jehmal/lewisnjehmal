  "fullText": "Where the battery system type is categorized as a toxic fume hazard in Table 3.1 the enclosure or room shall â€”\n(a) be made of materials suitable for the containment of the battery system's toxic fumes; and\n(b) be vented to ensure toxic fumes are vented outside of building to minimize levels below safe levels of toxicity.\nVentilation to the outside shall not be located in restricted locations for battery systems or BESS (see Clause 6.2.2.2).\nNOTE 1 Some toxic fumes are heavier than air, such as HF that is produced by lithium ion base battery technology. As such both inlet and outlet vents need to be considered.\nNOTE 2 Refer to Safe Work Australia or WorkSafe New Zealand for information regarding workplace exposure standards for airborne contaminants.\nWhere possible, natural ventilation should be used for battery system rooms and enclosures because of the fault potential of mechanical ventilation may result in unsafe levels of toxicity.\nWhere mechanical ventilation is used, the minimum flow rate shall keep toxic fumes below safe levels of toxicity.\nAn air flow sensor shall also be installed to activate an alarm and discontinue charging in the event of a fan failure."
