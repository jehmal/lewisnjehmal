  "fullText": "All battery system enclosures and battery system rooms containing sealed valve-regulated (sealed) type cells shall be ventilated.\nThe manufacturer's specified charging regime for sealed valve-regulated batteries shall be followed.\nUnder conditions of overcharge or electrical abuse, significant amounts of hydrogen gas can be generated and emitted from sealed valve-regulated cells. Further, the thermal and charge management of sealed valve-regulated cells is more critical than for vented cells, and generally the sealed valve-regulated cell will be irreversibly damaged when subjected to sustained electrical abuse.\nNOTE The chemistry of a sealed valve-regulated battery operates on an internal oxygen-recombination cycle which is arranged to suppress hydrogen gas evolution. Under normal operating conditions, hydrogen gas evolution and venting in sealed valve-regulated cells is much lower than the hydrogen gas released by conventional vented (flooded) cells. The hydrogen suppression efficiency in valve-regulated batteries varies with cell technology, but typically exceeds 80 % for gel cells and 90 % for absorbent glass mat cells."
