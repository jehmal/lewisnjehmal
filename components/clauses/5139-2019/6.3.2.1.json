  "title": "ARC FLASH",
  "fullText": "There is no possibility to completely avoid arc flash hazards when working near live parts. When working with battery systems, some parts of the battery system will remain energized. Work procedures shall take into account the need to limit exposure levels to arc flash hazard for installation and maintenance activities required for the battery system. The work procedures and installation design should facilitate that work be done with de-energized systems or systems being able to have exposure levels significantly reduced through isolation procedures.\nPersonal protection equipment (PPE) against arc flash is rated in accordance with the available energy from the arc flash, in calories per square centimetre (cal/cm2). When working on battery systems, the correct level of PPE based on the potential arc flash energy for the battery system shall be selected and worn within the arc flash boundary.\nSee Clause 3.2.4 for methods for calculating arc flash incident energy and arc flash boundaries.\nNOTE 1 Appendix F provides examples and tables for arc flash for various battery system voltages.\nNOTE 2 See Table 3.3 for further information on PPE ratings."
