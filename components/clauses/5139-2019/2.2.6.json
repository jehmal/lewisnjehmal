  "fullText": "This Clause applies to all BESSs. Figures 2.4 to 2.7 illustrate a number of available battery system types that may form part of a BESS.\nFigure 2.4 is an example of a BESS with battery system comprising individual battery cells (e.g. lead acid or nickel cadmium) connected in series without the need for any battery management system.\nFigure 2.5 is an example of a BESS with battery system comprising a number of lithium ion battery modules in parallel and/or series with the required battery management system.\nFigure 2.6 is an example of a BESS with battery system comprising individual lithium ion batteries, each having their own separate circuit board for all monitoring and/or balancing and interconnected with the battery management system.\nAuxiliary equipment as shown in this figure may include devices such as battery system alarms or fire suppression systems, or items such as inbuilt cooling systems and specific battery system communication devices.\nFigure 2.7 shows a BESS with a battery system comprising a flow battery module, auxiliary equipment and battery management system. Typical auxiliary equipment in this case may include pumps, leak detection alarms, pump controls and protection for auxiliaries."
