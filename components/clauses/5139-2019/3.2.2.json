  "title": "HAZARD CLASSIFICATION BY BATTERY TYPE",
  "fullText": "A battery energy storage system may comprise one or more battery types. Each of these battery types presents type-specific operating characteristics and hazards. The safe handling, installation, operation and servicing of different battery types rely on identifying which hazards are particular to each of the battery types and taking this into account in their installation.\nFor the purpose of this standard Table 3.1 sets out classifications of the specified battery type for a range of identified hazards. Sections 4, 5 and 6 of this standard then provide installation requirements for the minimizing of the risks so far as is reasonably practicable for each hazard classification shown. If the battery type intended for installation or servicing is not included as part of Table 3.1, a risk assessment shall be undertaken to categorize the battery type with respect to the hazard classifications stated in Table 3.1 or any other hazard relevant to that battery type.\nA copy of the risk assessment shall be included with the documentation provided to the client.\nNOTE 1 Notes to Table 3.1 provide further detail on classifications in for particular situations.\nNOTE 2 An example in the application of the risk management process is shown in Appendix G."
