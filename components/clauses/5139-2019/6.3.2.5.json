  "fullText": "The arc flash boundary shall be the distance at which incident energy equals 1.2 cal/cm2.\nThe arc flash boundary can be determined using the following equations:\nAFB = (0.0083 × Vsys × Iarc × Tarc × MF) 6.3.2(1)\nor\nAFB = ((0.01 × Vsys × Iarc × Tarc × MF) / 1.2) 6.3.2(2)\nwhere\nAFB = arc flash boundary, in centimetres\nVsys = system voltage, in volts\nIarc = arcing current, in amperes\nTarc = arcing time, in seconds (see Clause 3.2.4.2.3)\nMF = multiplying factor(see Clause 3.2.4.3)\nwhile\nIarc = 0.5 × Ibf\nwhere\nIbf = battery system prospective fault current in amps\nAn arc flash boundary nominal distance of 45 cm has been used for the calculation of incident energy. This is based on a \"nominal\" working distance (see Clause 3.2.4.2.2) and risk of injury to the body and face of persons working on equipment. It is necessary to ensure that measures are taken, for example, when working on battery cells, where a person's hands and arms may be within the arc flash boundary, where likely incident energy levels are far higher. As a result it is required that all tools used be insulated, and hand protection should also be used. The PPE equipment as required from Clause 3.2.4.4 shall be worn whenever a person intends to work in an area located within the determined arc flash boundary."
