  "fullText": "Battery systems may incorporate numerous devices in addition to the actual battery cell/s, including battery protection devices (these may be fuses or thermal devices that protect against short-circuit at the terminals), battery management modules, battery management systems, pumps, thermal management devices, fire suppression devices and auxiliary equipment.\nFor the purpose of protection and disconnection device requirements, the electrical output of a battery system is defined at a point where the voltage is that of the d.c. operating voltage of the complete battery system. For some battery types, the battery system comprises one single string of the battery type, for example lead acid batteries and flow batteries. For some technologies, a battery system may comprise battery modules in series and parallel that are connected to a battery management system. The electrical output is on the output terminals of the battery management system.\nSelection of a battery system or its subsets should take into account (but not be limited to) the following:\n(a) Compatible PCE.\n(b) Expected operational characteristics (maximum charge and discharge currents; rated capacity and timeframe for typical charge and discharge events; potential for partial state of charge operation).\n(c) Expected service life.\n(d) Available installation location including environmental factors.\n(e) Maximum acceptable nominal system voltage.\n(f) Additional hazard issues (see Clause 3.2).\n(g) Service provisions and ability to replace components."
