  "fullText": "Battery systems shall be protected from mechanical damage, environmental and other external influences. Where the location chosen may expose the battery system to influences that might be reasonably expected, then they should be considered as part of the installation conditions, e.g. damage caused by a vehicle if a system is being installed in a carport or garage.\nThe battery system shall be installed in one of the following:\n(a) A dedicated enclosure: An enclosed area that is not sufficiently large to allow a person to stand and move around inside. (See Clause 6.2.5.)\n(b) A dedicated room: An enclosed area that is accessible only via a door (or doors) of sufficient size to allow a person to enter and walk within this area. (See Clause 6.2.6.)\nThe dedicated enclosure or dedicated room shall contain only the battery system and the battery system's associated equipment or the BESS and any of its associated equipment.\nThe location of the battery system shall provide access to —\n(i) connections and any serviceable equipment; and\n(ii) doors and panels that are required to be accessed for installation and maintenance purposes.\nThe installation of battery systems or BESSs shall conform to the requirements for damp situations defined by AS/NZS 3000:2018 Section 6.\nBattery system and BESS locations shall be determined by outcome of the risk assessment (see Clause 6.2.1).\nSuitable locations for installation of battery systems and BESSs may include garages, storage rooms, a dedicated battery system room and verandas.\nA battery system or BESS installed in any corridor, hallway or lobby shall ensure sufficient clearance from the battery system for safe egress and be no less than 1 m.\nInstallation of a battery system or BESS should also take into account requirements for spacing between —\n(A) multiple BESS; and\n(B) the BESS and other associated equipment."
