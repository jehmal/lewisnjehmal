  "fullText": "Where the battery type is categorized as a toxic fume hazard in Table 3.1, the batteries battery modules or battery system shall be installed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Any instructions provided by the manufacturer shall be included in the documentation provided to the system owner (or nominated representative).\nThe battery system manufacturer or the SDS should be consulted when assessing the risk level of toxic fume hazard for the specific battery chemistry. The use of over voltage protection system applicable for the battery chemistry may reduce the production of toxic fumes generated to below safe levels of toxicity for some battery chemistries.\nNOTE As an example, over voltage protection that includes temperature compensated charge voltage management for lead acid batteries.\nWhere no instructions have been provided by the manufacturer and toxic fumes may be generated by the battery system then the risk of toxic fume exposure shall be mitigated by the methods detailed in Clause 6.3.7.2."
