  "fullText": "BESSs and battery systems use chemicals to store significant energy within a relatively compact space. The management of hazards associated with battery systems and BESSs shall be considered in the design and installation of these systems. Any battery energy storage system can present or create many or all of the hazards noted within this Section. This Section 3 details the types of hazards a battery system can present. Sections 4, 5 and 6 deal with design and installation practices to \"manage risks\" by eliminating health and safety risks so far as is reasonably practicable in dealing with these hazards.\nThe safety data sheets (SDSs) and the manufacturer's installation instructions shall be provided for all battery energy storage systems or their equipment subsets to set out specific information in relation to the hazards covered in this Section 3."
