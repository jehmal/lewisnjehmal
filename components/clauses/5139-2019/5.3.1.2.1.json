  "fullText": "Overcurrent protection shall be installed in all live conductors (excluding control and monitoring circuits) in all battery systems. The overcurrent protection shall be located so as to minimize the length of the unprotected cable from the battery system.\nThe overcurrent protection device shall â€”\n(a) be of the non-polarized type;\n(b) be d.c. rated;\n(c) have a voltage rating greater than the battery system's maximum voltage under all normal and abnormal operating conditions;\n(d) meet the requirements of AS/NZS 3000:2018 Section 2; and\n(e) have a current rating to protect the cabling from the pre-assembled battery system.\nNOTE 1 When connected to a system comprising multiple PCEs, the rated current of the BESS is the total sum of the currents that can be supplied from the PCEs to the battery system or the maximum rated current of the PCEs required to operate from the battery system.\nProtective devices may be integrated into pre-assembled battery systems (see Clause 5.3.1.2.4) or, if added externally, should be selected from the following:\n(i) Fuses having enclosed fuse-links (high rupturing capacity (HRC) fuses).\n(ii) Miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) or moulded case circuit-breakers (MCCBs).\nNOTE 2 MCBs and some MCCBs have limited d.c. short-circuit current ratings and may require back up by HRC fuses.\nWhere parallel pre-assembled battery systems are installed, each battery system shall include a separate overcurrent protective device. This is to prevent discharge from one battery system into a parallel battery system if a fault occurs in one battery system."
