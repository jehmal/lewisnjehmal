  "title": "BATTERY SYSTEM: INTERCONNECTION ISOLATING REQUIREMENTS",
  "fullText": "If the battery system includes individual battery or battery modules that are serviceable and has either —\n(a) a voltage exceeding DVC-A; or\n(b) is installed in a residential or domestic building and has an arc flash incident energy level above 4 cal/cm2;\nthe battery system installation shall be fitted with isolating switches, connectors, cables or links to separate the battery system into sections where each section has a voltage below DVC-A or sections that will reduce the arc flash incident energy levels to the levels in Clause 6.3.2 for the installation location and tasks required.\nSuitably identified interconnecting connectors, cables or links (e.g. with insulation of a different colour to other interconnecting devices) may be used for this purpose.\nThe interconnecting connectors, cables or links shall only be removed when the battery system's isolation device has been secured in the open position and before any work is carried out.\nThe current-carrying capacity of the battery interconnecting connectors, cables or links shall be rated to —\n(i) the maximum current rating of the battery system; and\n(ii) the short-circuit current and the duration from the battery system."
