  "title": "ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR A DISCONNECTION DEVICE INTEGRATED INTO BATTERY SYSTEM",
  "fullText": "The battery system may include an internal isolation device operating in all live conductors. Where a readily accessible internal isolation device provides the same functions as for an adjacent isolation device, no additional adjacent isolation device is required.\nIf the battery system includes a BMS that meets the overcurrent protection requirements but does not provide the same function as for an isolation device, an adjacent isolation device shall be installed that isolates the output of the battery system."
