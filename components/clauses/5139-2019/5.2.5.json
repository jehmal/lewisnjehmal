  "title": "PRE-ASSEMBLED BATTERY SYSTEM ROOM REQUIREMENTS",
  "fullText": "Where pre-assembled battery systems are installed within a room, they shall be located so that access to the battery systems are not obstructed by the structure of the building, fixtures and fittings within the room.\nThe room should be clean, dry and ventilated and provide and maintain protection against detrimental environmental conditions and other external factors. In addition the room should be selected to minimize likelihood of a build up of other materials around or on the battery system, or an infestation of insect or vermin, or similar issues occurring that may cause a hazard.\nThe size of the room shall allow for sufficient clearance around the pre-assembled battery system to provide safe handling and access for installation, removal and maintenance.\nThe pre-assembled battery system minimum unimpeded access on the working side of a system shall be no less than 600 mm or the clearance specified by the manufacturer, whichever is greater. Where access panels allow access to 230 V a.c. connections, the minimum clearance shall be 900 mm."
