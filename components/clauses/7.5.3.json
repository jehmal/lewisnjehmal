        "fullText": "The source supplying a SELV or PELV system shall be one of the following: (a) A safety isolating transformer complying with AS/NZS 61558. (b) A source of current independent of a higher voltage supply, such as an engine-driven generator, or an electrochemical source, such as a battery. (c) A source of current separated from higher voltage electrical installations, such as a motor-generator set, with electrically separate windings having a degree of electrical separation equivalent to that specified by Item (a). (d) Certain electronic devices complying with appropriate Standards, where, in the case of an internal fault, the voltage at the output terminals cannot exceed extra-low voltage. Higher voltages at the output terminals may be used, provided that the voltage at the output terminals is immediately reduced to extra-low voltage if contact is made with live parts under normal or fault conditions. NOTE: Such devices include insulation testing equipment.",
