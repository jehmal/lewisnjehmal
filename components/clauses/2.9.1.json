Typical applications include the following:\n(a) In premises with sleeping accommodation.\n(b) In locations with risks of fire due to the nature of processed or stored materials (e.g. barns, wood-working shops, stores of combustible materials).\n(c) In locations with combustible construction materials (e.g. wooden buildings).\n(d) In fire propagating structures.\n\nNOTE: See Appendix O for more details.\n\nWhere AFDDs are installed, the requirements of Clauses 2.9.2 to 2.9.4 apply.\n\nNOTE: The use of AFDDs does not obviate the need to apply any other measures required by other clauses in this Standard."
