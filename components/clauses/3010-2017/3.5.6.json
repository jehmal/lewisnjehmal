    "fullText": "Where an alternative supply is provided, an automatic changeover switch shall be installed on the main switchboard to allow supply for the alternative system to be connected to the safety services.\nThe time taken for automatic changeover to an emergency supply system shall not be greater than that permitted by safety considerations for the type of load supplied.\nChangeover times are classified as follows:\n(a)\tNo break An automatic supply that can ensure a continuous supply within specified conditions during the period of transition, e.g. as regards variations in voltage and frequency.\n(b)\tShort break  An automatic supply available within 1 s.\n(c)\tMedium break  An automatic supply available within 30 s.\n(d)\tLong break  An automatic supply available in more than 30 s.\nNOTE: Where no break in supply can be tolerated, it is not uncommon for the generating set to be run continuously as the normal supply and the electricity distribution system used as the alternative supply system. As stated in Clause 1.1, such forms of supply are not covered in this Standard except for minimum requirements that affect safety."
