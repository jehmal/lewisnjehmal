    "fullText": "All outgoing circuits from a generating set shall be provided with overcurrent protection at the generating set, except where an alternative position, or the omission of overcurrent protective devices, is permitted by AS/NZS 3000.\nNOTES:\n1\tA generating set has limited fault output current available under fault conditions to operate overcurrent protection devices, the fault current available being dependant on the alternator type and the alternator voltage regulator and the mechanical power available from the engine of the generating set.\n2\tSuitable overcurrent protection devices for alternator or generator overcurrent protection are made by some, but not all manufacturers. Reference to the overcurrent and alternator data is required for the correct selection of a suitable overcurrent protective device.\nException:\nWiring systems connecting generating sets to their associated switchboards need not be provided with short-circuit protection provided that the wiring systems are installed in such a way as to reduce the risk of a short-circuit to a minimum. Methods that can achieve this are wiring systems installed within the same fire-rated generator room (2 h minimum) utilizingâ€”\n(a)\tinsulated and sheathed cable(s) installed within a dedicated conduit duct or pipe;\n(b)\tinsulated and sheathed cable(s) installed on a dedicated cable tray or an area of a cable tray segregated from other cables by barriers; or\n(c)\tbusway or busbar systems, including joints and switchboard busbars, having insulation up to the first protective device."
