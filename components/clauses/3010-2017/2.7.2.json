    "fullText": "The operation of changeover devices shall be such that the operation of the changeover device does not inadvertently or intentionally breach the integrity of the neutral conductor with reference to the MEN connection contained either within the installation's main switchboard or the switchboard to which the generator is connected, as follows.\n(a)\tGeneral  Changeover devices shall interrupt one source of supply before connecting the other source of supply.\nException: When a closed transition changeover device is fitted, the interruption of one source of supply before the connection of another source of supply is not required.\n(b)\tActive switching  Changeover devices shall operate in all active conductors.\n(c)\tNeutral switching Where the MEN system of earthing is used, changeover devices shall not disconnect the neutral conductor of the incoming normal supply at the main switchboard where the MEN link is provided.\nA switched neutral pole of a mechanical changeover device shall break not before, and shall make not after, the other poles. If a changeover device pole having an appropriate short-circuit breaking and making capacity is used as a neutral pole, then all poles, including the neutral pole, shall operate substantially together.\n(d)\tEarthing conductor switching Changeover devices shall not operate in any earthing conductor.\nNOTE: Examples of changeover arrangements are shown in Figures 2.1 and 2.2."
