    "fullText": "This Standard sets out the minimum safety requirements related to the use of generating sets for the supply of electricity at low voltage, that is, not exceeding 1000 V a.c or 1500 V d.c.\nThe Standard applies to electricity generating sets that are driven by internal combustion engines, and forms any of the following:\n(a)\tNormal supply source for electrical installations.\n(b)\tAlternative supply source for electrical installations.\n(c)\tElectrical supply source for the connection of electrical appliances and portable tools.\n(d)\tSupply sources that operate in parallel with the normal supply in the electrical installation.\nThis Standard does notâ€”\n(i)\tapply to uninterruptible power supplies; or\n(ii)\tapply to other renewable energy generation systems, such as, the following:\n(A)\tInverters.\n(B)\tPhotovoltaic arrays.\n(C)\tWater or wind driven turbines.\nNOTE: While intended to be applied to low voltage generating sets driven by internal combustion engines, the electrical principles could be applied to other types of energy sources."
