    "fullText": "A supply voltage giving additional protection against electric shock such as the following:\n(a)\tA single-phase system in which—\n(i)\tthe nominal line-to-line voltage does not exceed 110 V a.c.;\n(ii)\tthe nominal line-to-earth voltage does not exceed 55 V a.c.; and\n(iii)\tall exposed conductive parts are connected to the protective conductor.\nor\n(b)\tA three-phase system in which—\n(i)\tthe nominal line-to-line voltage does not exceed 110 V a.c.;\n(ii)\tthe nominal line-to-earth voltage does not exceed 63.5 V a.c.; and\n(iii)\tall exposed conductive parts are connected to the protective conductor."
