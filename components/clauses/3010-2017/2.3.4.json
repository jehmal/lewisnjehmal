    "title": "Protection against fuel leakage",
    "fullText": "Any tanks or filling facilities associated with flammable fuels shall not beâ€”\n(a)\tinstalled in the vicinity of high temperature surfaces or equipment that may emit arcs, sparks or hot particles; or\n(b)\tlocated in such a position that spilled or leaking fuel could fall on such high temperature surfaces or equipment.\nNOTES:\n1\tAttention is drawn to additional requirements that may be specified by relevant Regulatory Authorities. These may include the specific location of the fuel tank(s), the standard used for the construction of the fuel tank, the need for secondary containment of the fuel tank and associated pipework. Certification of the completed fuel system installation may also be required.\n2\tIn Australia, refer to AS 1940 for additional requirements affecting the storage and handling of flammable and combustible fuels.\n3\tIn New Zealand, the WorkSafe New Zealand (http://www.worksafe.govt.nz) has additional requirements controlling the storage and handling of flammable and combustible fuels associated with generating sets."
