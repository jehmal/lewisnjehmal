    "title": "Automatic changeover to normal supply",
    "fullText": "Where an automatic changeover device is provided, it shall operate to transfer loads back to the normal supply after the voltage and frequency of the normal supply have been maintained at normal levels on all phases for a specified period, except that in the case of failure of the generating set supply, the transfer shall occur without delay, provided a normal supply is available.\nAn automatic transfer switch (ATS) used as a main switch shall have operating handles or controls associated with the ATS that enables the main switch to be manually operated, single action, mechanical and shall consist of a handle, lever, push buttons or similar device.\nElectronic touch screens, programmable control systems or the like shall not be used as a means of operating the ATS where used as a main switch.\nNOTES:\n1\tWhere the automatic changeover device provides the control for a high reliability site, the transfer of the loading from the generator supply to normal supply may be prevented until a switching break in the supply to the load can be arranged to suit operational requirements, except in the case of the failure of the generating set supply, the transfer should occur without delay, provided a normal supply is available.\n2\tThe specified period is usually controlled by an adjustable delay of between 1 min and 30 minâ€”typically the delay selected is 15 min.\n3\tA further delay period prior to shutting down the generating set engine may be necessary to allow adequate cool-down of particular engines types."
