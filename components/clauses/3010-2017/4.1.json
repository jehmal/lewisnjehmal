    "fullText": "This Section specifies additional requirements for generating sets that are connected to an electrical installation by means of a detachable connection [e.g. flexible cable (or cord) with plug and cord connector fittings].\nSuch connections are generally of a temporary nature where an independent or alternative supply is required and whereâ€”\n(a)\tthe installation of a permanently connected generating set is not justified; and\n(b)\tthe connection of the generating set is expected to be carried out by non-qualified persons.\nThe additional requirements shall be applied to the general requirements for generating sets given in Section 2 of this Standard when connected by installation wiring to the appliance inlet connector.\nNOTES:\n1\tAn example of connecting a generating set to an electrical installation main switchboard by a detachable connection are shown in Figure 4.2 for three-phase and Figure 4.3 for single-phase.\n2\tOther earthing systems Alternatives to MEN and segregated earthing systems may be permitted, provided that the requirements of Part 1 of AS/NZS 3000 are satisfied, e.g. TN-S earthing.\nThis Section does not apply to generating sets used for the direct supply to portable tools and appliances using the socket outlet(s) fitted to the generating set, see Appendix B for guidance."
