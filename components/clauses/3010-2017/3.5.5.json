    "fullText": "A single generating set shall not be used for purposes other than the supply of essential or safety services in accordance with Clause 3.5.1 unless suitable precautions are taken to ensure that the supply to the essential or safety services will not be affected by the additional loading under any conditions of operation.\nWhere more than one emergency supply system provides a source of supply, such sources may be used for the supply of other than emergency systems or safety services provided that, in the event of failure of one source, the supply remaining available will be sufficient for the operation of all emergency systems or safety services.\nNOTE: This requirement generally necessitates the automatic load-shedding of circuits not supplying emergency systems or safety services."
