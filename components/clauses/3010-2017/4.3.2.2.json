    "fullText": "The connection of the portable generating set equipotential bonding system to the switchboard earthing system provides the protective earthing requirement as detailed in AS/NZS 3000.\nThe connection of a portable generating set equipotential bonding system to the general mass of earth through a separate earth electrode is not a general requirement of this Standard.\nNOTE: In New Zealand, when connecting a generator supply at a switchboard without a neutral earth connection, an earth electrode is required in accordance with Clause 2.7.10.2 (b).\nAppendix A explains why the connection of the generator equipotential bonding system to the general mass of the earth is not permitted other than via an electrical installation's earth electrode in accordance with AS/NZS 3000."
