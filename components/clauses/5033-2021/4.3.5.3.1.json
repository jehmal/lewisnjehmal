  "fullText": "The load break disconnection device shall â€”\n(a) meet the requirements of Clause 4.4.7;\n(b) be readily available;\nNOTE 1 Where the load break disconnection device is mounted underneath PV modules, it is not considered readily available unless it meets all the requirements of the readily available definition and there is room to mount the disconnector and its enclosure in the vertical mounting position.\n(c) be marked in accordance with Clause 5.5.2.1;\n(d) be documented in accordance with Clause 5.6;\n(e) be installed external to the building;\n(f) meet one or more of the following requirements to protect against the spread of fire:\n(i) Be contained in metal enclosures that are made of metal surfaces of at least 0.2mm thickness;\n(ii) Be mounted on a non-combustible and mechanically stable surface that extends at least 200mm beyond the sides of the load break disconnector. The surface or barrier material is considered suitably non-combustible if the composite material is deemed to be not combustible when tested in accordance with AS 1530.1. The following materials are considered non-combustible and need not be tested to AS 1530.1:\n(A) brick or masonry block;\n(B) concrete;\n(C) compressed cement sheeting;\n(D) ceramic or terracotta tiles; and\n(E) metallic surface of at least 0.2 mm thickness;\n(iii) Be mounted on non-combustible shrouds that:\n(A) are made of metal surfaces of at least 0.2 mm thickness; and\n(B) meet the requirements of Clause 4.4.7.3 (b).\n(g) have any penetration through a surface that protects against the spread of fire, and that has an internal free space greater than 5mm diameter, sealed with a fire retardant sealant.\nNOTE 2 Installation of a disconnection device on a PV module is not recommended. Under some circumstances this could void warranty or make replacement difficult."
