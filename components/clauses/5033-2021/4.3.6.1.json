  "fullText": "Where overcurrent protection is required, the following apply:\n(a) Overcurrent protection device ratings shall be equivalent to the nominal overcurrent protection ratings as specified in Clause 3.3 adjusted for temperature of the environment where they are installed.\nNOTE Temperature de-rating factors should be considered while sizing overcurrent protection devices. This may require careful rating assessment to avoid nuisance tripping or under protection.\n(b) Overcurrent protection devices shall have a voltage rating greater than or equal to the calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage in accordance with Clause 4.2.1.3.\n(c) Overcurrent protection devices shall meet any additional requirements specified in Clause 4.3.4 where used as a disconnection device.\nSemiconductor (solid-state) devices shall not be used for overcurrent protection purposes."
