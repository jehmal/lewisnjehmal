  "fullText": "The installation shall not result in the maximum rated operating temperature of any component being exceeded.\nThe manufacturer's specified temperature derating/rerating shall be applied to the nominal values of components such as fuses, switches, and circuit breakers according to the maximum temperature to which the component is subjected when installed.\nPV module ratings provided by manufacturers are stated at STC.\nPV modules operate at elevated temperatures when installed. PV modules can be expected to operate at approximately 25 °C above the ambient temperature in a typical installation with very good ventilation under full sun (1 000 W/m2). The temperature rise can be considerably higher when irradiance levels are greater than 1 000 W/m2 and when PV modules have poor ventilation (40 °C to 50 °C rises are possible).\nThe following recommendations on the PV array design are made based on the operating characteristic of PV modules:\n(a) For most PV technologies, the efficiency reduces as the operating temperature increases. Therefore, adequate ventilation of the PV array should be a design goal, in order to ensure optimum performance for both PV modules and associated components.\nNOTE 1 For crystalline silicon PV cells the maximum power decrease may be between 0.3 % and 0.5 % per each degree Celsius rise in operating temperature above STC.\n(b) All the components and equipment that are in direct contact or near the PV array (conductors, PCEs, connectors, etc.) should be capable of withstanding the expected maximum operating temperature of the PV array.\nNOTE 2 PV modules have voltage increases under cold conditions (see Clause 4.2 for further considerations)."
