  "title": "CONSIDERATIONS DUE TO FAULT CONDITIONS WITHIN A PV ARRAY",
  "fullText": "The source of fault currents shall be identified in any installation.\nSystems connected to PCE and/or external sources such as batteries, may have high prospective fault currents due to the equipment's characteristics, see Clause 3.3.2.\nPV modules (and consequently PV arrays) behave like current sources under low impedance faults. Consequently, fault currents may not be much greater than normal full load currents, even under short circuit conditions.\nThe fault current depends on the number of strings, the fault location and the irradiance level. This makes short circuit detection within a PV array very difficult. Electric arcs can be formed in a PV array with fault currents that would not operate an overcurrent device.\nThe implications for PV array design that arise from these PV array characteristics are as follows:\n(a) The possibility of line-to-line faults, earth faults and inadvertent wire disconnections in the PV array should be minimized more than for conventional electrical installations.\nNOTE 1 In conventional electrical installations the large inherent fault current capability of the system will generally operate a fuse, circuit-breaker or other protection system under fault conditions.\n(b) Earth fault detection, alarm, shutdown, or both, could be required as part of the system protection functions to reduce the risk of fire.\nNOTE 2 See Clause 3.3 for overcurrent protection requirements and Clause 3.5 for earth fault protection requirements."
