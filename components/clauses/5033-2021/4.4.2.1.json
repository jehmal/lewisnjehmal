  "fullText": "The requirements for the selection of cables in this Clause relates to PV d.c. cables. For the selection of earth cables and other cables, refer to AS/NZS 3000.\nPV d.c. cables shall:\n(a) have a voltage rating greater than or equal to the calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage in accordance with Clause 4.2.1.3—\n(i) for all installations, between the positive conductor and negative conductor; and\n(ii) for non-separated PCE and functionally earthed installations, between any conductor and earth;\nNOTE 1 Examples of cable manufacturers' methods to specify rating are 0.6/1kVAC 0.9/1.8kVDC. This indicates:\n(a) a 600V conductor to earth AC voltage rating and a 1000V conductor to conductor AC voltage\n(b) a 900V conductor to earth d.c. voltage rating and a 1800V conductor to conductor d.c. voltage rating\n(b) conform to IEC 62930 where not installed underground;\nNOTE 2 For cable that installed underground, see Clause 4.4.2.5.\n(c) be suitable for d.c. application;\n(d) have each conductor double insulated for where the calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage is above 35 V, see Figure 4.4;\nNOTE 3 For cables directly terminated to plugs, socket and connectors, see Clause 4.3.8.\n(e) have a temperature rating appropriate for the application; and\n(f) if exposed to the environment, be UV-resistant, or be protected from UV light by appropriate protection.\n+ +\nOR\nFigure 4.4 — Single conductor cable both insulated and sheathed\nNOTE 4 Where installed in buildings, it is recommended that halogen free cables are used i.e. cables qualified to IEC 62930 IEC 131 or IEC 62930 IEC 132.\nCables directly terminated to plugs, socket and connectors as specified in Clause 4.3.8, shall be class 5 (flexible) in accordance with IEC 60228.\nNOTE 5 Examples where such cables are required are: string cables; trackers, and where cables are connected using plugs and sockets. Refer to IEC 62738 for more guidance on wire management for trackers.\nNOTE 6 For other cables, the conductor of the cable can be class 2 (stranded) or class 5 (flexible) in accordance with IEC 60228."
