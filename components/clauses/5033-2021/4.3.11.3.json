  "fullText": "Where DCUs are directly connected to PV module(s) with a calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage of less than 120 V d.c. at the DCU PV input, and where the PV module(s) are within 1.5 m of the DCU, a disconnection device shall be installed adjacent to the PV module(s).\nWhere plug, sockets and connectors are used as the disconnection device, they shall meet the requirements of Clause 4.3.8.\nWhere DCUs are directly connected to PV module(s) with a calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage greater than or equal to 120 V, the method of isolation shall be equivalent to the PV isolation method, see Clause 4.3.3.1.\nNOTE 1 PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage for the DCU PV input can be calculated as specified in Clause 4.2.1.3.\nNOTE 2 Adaptor leads are used where the plugs/sockets on the PV module are not from the same manufacturer as the DCU plugs/sockets. These adaptor cables have a module compatible plug/socket on one end and an DCU compatible plug/socket on the other end, enabling the mating of plugs and sockets from the same manufacturer as required in this document. See Clauses 4.3.8 and 4.3.9."
