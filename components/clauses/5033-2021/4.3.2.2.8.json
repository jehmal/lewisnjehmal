    "fullText": "PV module mounting frames, and the methods used for attaching PV modules to frames and frames to buildings or to the ground, shall be made from corrosion resistant materials suitable for the lifetime and duty of the system (e.g. aluminium, galvanized steel or H3 treated timber).\nIf the associated roofing or building structure is metallic, then aluminium, stainless steel, hot dipped galvanized steel, wood or polymer materials shall be used.\nAll framing systems shall be suitable for the location and duty of the system.\nNOTE Care should be taken in selecting materials and protection in marine and other corrosive environments.\nIn coastal areas, the fitting of PV modules to a roof that is exposed to salt laden air may prevent salt deposits from being washed off the roof by rain.\nMaintenance instructions as well as roof mounting structure configuration should allow for regular wash down with fresh water.\nAll bolts, nuts and fasteners shall have appropriate durability for the installed locality. Bolts and nuts should typically be stainless steel.\nCare shall be taken to prevent electrochemical corrosion between dissimilar metals. This may occur between structures and the building and between structures, fasteners and PV modules. Stand-off materials shall be used to reduce electrochemical corrosion between galvanically dissimilar metal surfaces (e.g. nylon washers or rubber insulators). Aluminium framing components and stainless fasteners are permitted to be in direct contact (without stand-off materials) as the two metals are sufficiently galvanically similar."
