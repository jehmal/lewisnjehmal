    "title": "Additional mechanical protection requirements",
    "fullText": "Where PV d.c. cables are installed within buildings, additional mechanical protection shall be provided—\n(a) enclosed in metal or heavy-duty insulating conduit where installed within a ceiling space, in wall cavities or under a floor; or\n(b) installed in medium duty insulating wiring enclosure in other locations within buildings.\nNOTE 1 Examples of other locations could be internal to a building but not concealed (e.g. surface mounted).\nEXCEPTION — In a non-domestic electrical installation where it can be demonstrated that the installation method achieves the objective of minimizing short circuit risk, additional mechanical protection is not required.\nWhere PV d.c. cables are installed external to the building, and not in a restricted access location, they shall be installed in a wiring enclosure to ensure restricted access of the PV d.c cables.\nWhere PV d.c. cables are installed external to the building and in a restricted access location, there are no additional mechanical protection requirements for the wiring system.\nNOTE 2 Where the wiring system is installed near building surfaces (such as those concealed within 50 mm from a surface), extra protection methods beyond the requirements of this Clause may be required to meet AS/NZS 3000.\nNOTE 3 This Clause should be read in conjunction with the mechanical protection requirements of AS/NZS 3000.\nEXCEPTION — A maximum distance of no more than 300 mm of unprotected PV d.c. cable is allowed at the PCE or the load break disconnection device, provided the location is not subject to mechanical damage. This exception applies to PCE or load break disconnection devices installed internally or externally to the building."
