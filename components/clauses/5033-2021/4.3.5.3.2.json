  "fullText": "Where there are more than two parallel strings with string fusing installed on all strings, a load break disconnection device shall be installed at the connection point, where the strings are paralleled together.\nNOTE 1 This is to enable isolation of the sub-array or array cable from the paralleled strings.\nSee Clause 4.3.7.1 for string fuse installation location.\nEXCEPTION 1 — PV arrays on large-scale ground mounted PV power plants, that may use this Standard as a guide, can apply an alternate requirement of connecting up to four parallel strings before connecting to a load break disconnection device subject to—\n(a) the PV installation shall have restricted access to personnel;\n(b) the PV system shall be connected to dedicated high voltage systems;\n(c) the PV system shall be specifically designed for this parallel string configuration taking into account safe engineering practices;\n(d) the parallel strings shall be from a single solar tracker;\n(e) the individual strings shall be joined together to a common PV array cable that shall go to a combiner box;\n(f) the common PV cable shall be connected to a load break disconnection device located at the combiner box; and\n(g) there is string fusing installed on all strings, using inline fuses placed on each string as close as possible to the point where that strings joins to the common PV array cable.\nEXCEPTION 2 — For PV arrays on large-scale ground mounted PV power plants with restricted access to personnel, connected to dedicated high voltage systems, where there are more than four parallel strings with string fusing installed on all strings, a load break disconnection device shall be installed at the connection point, where the strings are paralleled together.\nNOTE 2 Examples of this configuration may include equipment such as harness wiring systems for solar farms."
