  "fullText": "The nominal overcurrent protection current to which the PV system is rated shall be calculated in accordance with the Table 3.1.\nNOTE This Clause determines the nominal ratings of overcurrent protection. The actual rating of the overcurrent protection device may be de-rated/re-rated depending on the environment where they are installed, see Clause 4.3.6.1.\n\nTable 3.1 — Nominal overcurrent protection rating calculations\nRelevant circuit | No DCUs | Partial DCUs | Containing DCUs on all modules\nString | For single PV string (see Figures 2.3 and 2.4) 1.2a x ISTRING MAX < In ≤ IMOD MAX OCPR | 1.2a x ISTRING MAX < In ≤ IMOD MAX OCPR and In ≤ I DCU OCPR | ISTRING MAX < In ≤ I DCU OCPR\nSub-Array | In ≥ SSA x ISTRING MAXb\nArray | In ≥ SA x ISTRING MAXb\n\na The 1.2 multiplier is used for string fusing only.\nb The 1.2 multiplier is not used here to allow designer flexibility. Care should be taken when using a lower multiplier in areas where heightened irradiance occurs frequently, as this can cause nuisance overcurrent operation.\n\nNOTE 1 Circuit breakers are not recommended for string overcurrent protection.\nNOTE 2 In high irradiance areas considerations should be given to choosing a fuse in the higher range of ratings allowed to avoid the likelihood of early fuse failure.\nNOTE 3 In some PV module technologies ISC MOD is higher than the nominal rated value during the first weeks or months of operation. This should be taken into account when establishing overcurrent protection and cable ratings.\nNOTE 4 See Clause 1.4 for notations."
