  "fullText": "Where the calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage is above 35 V, the PV array shall be protected against earth faults.\nRequirements for detection of faults, actions required, and alarms depend on the type of system earthing, and the status of the separation/isolation of the PCE that is connected to the PV array.\nPCE charge controllers used for all systems where the calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage is above 120 V shall also provide fault detection and alarm functions.\nNOTE 1 See Appendix B for examples of earthing systems and earth faults.\nNOTE 2 IEC 62109-2 specifies inverter requirements based on inverter isolation and array earthing, and requirements for initiation of earth fault alarms either during operation or on start-up of the inverter, or both.\nNOTE 3 Manufacturers should provide instructions for installation of different types of inverters dependent on the inverter's internal protection and system configuration in accordance with IEC 62109-2.\nThe external alarm function provided in the inverter (refer to IEC 62109-2) shall be used to activate an earth fault alarm as detailed in Clause 3.5.3."
