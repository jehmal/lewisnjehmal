  "title": "COMMISSIONING TESTS",
  "fullText": "The following tests shall be carried out after the installation of a PV array and before connecting strings to other circuits:\n(a) Before commencement of the installation of PV system, check that radio and TV reception in the key broadcast stations (essential services) are in normal operational and record irregularities.\n(b) Check and record the continuity of all strings, sub-array and array connections.\n(c) Check and record the continuity of all earth connections including the PV module frame earth connections.\n(d) Check and record the voltage and polarity of all string, sub-array and array voltages.\n\nNOTE 1 String short circuit currents and irradiance at time of the measurement may be checked at this stage if required. See Clause 6.3.3 for instructions on safe short circuit instructions.\n\n(e) Connect the strings to the other array wiring.\n(f) Perform insulation resistance check of array wiring to earth. Follow the insulation resistance measurement procedure specified in Clause 4.7.3.3.\n(g) Remove insulation test equipment and restore array connections. Close the PV array disconnector and check the operation of the array under load conditions in the system installed.\n(h) Check and record the operational voltage of the PV array and the PV array current.\n(i) Operational string currents may also be checked in a multi-string array at this time.\n(j) Operate the PV array disconnector while the system is operating (i.e. under load) and make sure it safely isolates the PCE from the array.\n(k) Check that radio and TV reception in the reception of key broadcast stations (essential services) are not degraded when the installation is fully operational."
