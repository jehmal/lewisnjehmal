  "title": "PV MODULE MAXIMUM VOLTAGE CALCULATION",
  "fullText": "The PV module maximum voltage is equal to VOC MOD corrected for the lowest expected operating temperature, as follows:\nVMOD MAX = VOC MOD + γv (Tmin - TSTC)\nCorrection of the voltage for the lowest expected operating temperature shall be carried out by any of the following:\n(a) Using the formula above.\n(b) Calculated according to the PV module manufacturer's instructions.\n(c) Where manufacturer's instructions are not available for crystalline and multi-crystalline silicon PV modules, multiplying VOC MOD by a correction factor according to Table 4.1, using the lowest expected operating temperature as a reference.\n(d) Where the lowest expected operating temperature is below −40 °C, or where technologies other than crystalline or multi-crystalline silicon are in use, voltage correction made in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.\nDeviations from these methods that account for the coincidence of irradiance and lowest expected operating temperatures may be permitted with engineering justification.\nNOTE The various methods above give either conservative or more specific maximum PV array voltage values depending on the method.\n\nTable 4.1 — Voltage correction factors for crystalline and multi-crystalline silicon PV modules\nLowest expected operating temperature °C | Correction factors\n24 to 20 | 1.02\n19 to 15 | 1.04\n14 to 10 | 1.06\n9 to 5 | 1.08\n4 to 0 | 1.10\n−1 to −5 | 1.12\n−6 to −10 | 1.14\n−11 to −15 | 1.16\n−16 to −20 | 1.18\n−21 to −25 | 1.20\n−26 to −30 | 1.21\n−31 to −35 | 1.23\n−36 to −40 | 1.25"
