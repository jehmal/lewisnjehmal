  "fullText": "The following Clause is taken from IEC 62548 ed.1.0, Copyright Â© 2016 IEC Geneva, Switzerland. www.iec.ch\nDCUs shall conform to IEC 62109-1 and any other applicable Part of the IEC 62109 series.\nThe PV input of DCUs shall be rated for the input circuit calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage.\nThe PV d.c. circuit of the input of a DCU typically consists of modules only. See Clause 4.2.1.3.1 for calculation of PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage based on the number of modules in the DCU input circuit.\nThe PV input of DCUs shall have an ISC PV rating of at least 1.25 x KI x ISC MOD except where overcurrent protection is provided that is rated to protect the DCU.\nNOTE 1 Refer to the applicable parts of IEC 62109 series for details on d.c.-d.c. converters."
