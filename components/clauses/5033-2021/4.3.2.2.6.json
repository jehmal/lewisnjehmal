  "fullText": "The following Clause is reproduced from CEC Install and Supervise Guidelines for Accredited Installers, Version 13, April 2019. Â© The Clean Energy Council 2019. Used with permission. All rights reserved.\nPV modules should be attached to the array structure either using the mounting holes provided by the manufacturer or via clamps that are suitable for the maximum wind at the site.\nWhen using clamps, the mounting system and solar module manufacturer's installation instructions shall be followed. The following shall be considered:\n(a) The number of clamps required for a given wind load and mounting configuration.\n(b) The location of clamps (e.g. amount of overhang allowed from clamp to end of module).\n(c) The size of clamp required (length, width and minimum engagement of frame).\n(d) The quantity, location and dimensions of underlying support beams.\n(e) The clamp force specifications for the fasteners.\nWhere modules are installed in such way that a junction box is to the side or at the bottom, care should be taken to ensure that it is in accordance with manufacturer's requirements.\nNOTE Attaching a PV module in such a manner that creates a hole in the anodised aluminium frame of the solar module (e.g. drilling, pop riveting) typically voids the manufacturer's product warranty with respect to defects in material and workmanship."
