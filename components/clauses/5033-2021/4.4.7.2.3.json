  "title": "CONDUITS TERMINATING INTO ENCLOSURES CONTAINING DISCONNECTION DEVICES",
  "fullText": "Where a continuous conduit system has a section that is in an outdoor environment, and that terminates into an enclosure containing a disconnection device, it shall have a device to drain liquid from the conduit system. This shall be installed at the lowest point of the conduit system and shall be rated to at least IP 56. See Figure 4.10 and Figure 4.11.\n\nWhere a continuous conduit system has a section that is in an outdoor environment, and that terminates into an enclosure containing conductor terminations, any open ends of the conduit system shall be sealed with a gland conforming to Clause 4.4.7.2.2.\n\nWhere conduits and fittings enter/exit the side face of an enclosure installed in an outdoor location, the entry/exit point into the enclosure containing conductor terminations shall be in accordance with item (i) or item (ii) of Clause 4.4.7.2.2.\n\nNOTE 1 Clause 4.4.6.2 may require pressure equalization devices to be installed in disconnector enclosures. This has a different function to the device to drain liquid from the conduit system.\n\nWhere a conduit system has a section that is in an outdoor environment, but the conduit system does not terminate into an enclosure containing a disconnection device, a device to drain liquid may not be required. See Figure 4.7 and Figure 4.8 for examples of installations where conduit systems do not terminate into enclosures containing disconnection devices."
