  "fullText": "PV arrays shall be designed to prevent circulating currents within the array. PV strings connected in parallel shall have matched open circuit voltages within 5 % per string.\nNOTE 1 This is an important safety issue. If strings which are connected in parallel have different voltages, circulating currents will result. When the array d.c. disconnector is in the open position, those circulating currents may still flow representing a hazard if series connections are broken.\nTo reduce mismatch and improve PV array yield, all PV modules connected to the same PCE maximum power point tracking (MPPT) input should be of the same technology and have the same number of series-connected PV modules (see Figures 2.2 to 2.4). In addition, all PV modules connected to the same PCE MPPT input should have similar rated electrical characteristics including short circuit current, open circuit voltage, maximum power current, maximum power voltage and rated power and temperature coefficients.\nNOTE 2 This is a design issue which should be considered by designer/installer, particularly when replacing PV modules or modifying an existing system.\nPV modules that are electrically in the same series string shall be within ± 5 degrees azimuth and ± 5 degrees tilt angle.\nNOTE 3 Each parallel PV string may have a different orientation.\nWhere each PV module (or small groups of PV modules) is connected to individual MPPT devices and the outputs of those devices are then connected to an inverter or other PCE, each of those PV modules or groups may be oriented differently provided the overall design is within the manufacturer's recommended design parameters.\nNOTE 4 DCUs can contain MPPT units and so enable the connection of modules in different orientations as per Clause 2.1.5."
