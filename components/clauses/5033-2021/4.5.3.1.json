  "fullText": "There shall be a load break disconnection device at the PCE to break the current on PV d.c. circuits. This shall be done by one of the following methods:\n(a) An adjacent and physically separate load break disconnection device in accordance with Clause 4.3.4.2; or\n(b) A load break disconnection device that is part of and within the PCE, where the device and the PCE conform to AS/NZS 4777.2.\n\nEXCEPTION 1 A load break disconnection device is not required where:\n(a) the disconnection device conforms to Clause 4.3.3.2.2;\n(b) the calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage is less than 120 V d.c. at the inverter PV input;\n(c) the PV module(s) are direct connected to this disconnection device; and\n(d) the PV module(s) is within 1.5m of the inverter.\n\nEXCEPTION 2 A disconnection device is not required for a.c. module inverters.\n\nFor inverters that exceed the limits of Exception 1, the normal requirements of this document apply.\n\nNOTE 1 Adaptor leads are used where the plugs/sockets on the PV module are not from the same manufacturer as the inverter plugs/sockets. These adaptor cables have a module compatible plug/socket on one end and an inverter compatible plug/socket on the other end, enabling the mating of plugs and sockets from the same manufacturer as required in this Standard. See Clause 4.3.8 and Clause 4.3.9.\n\nNOTE 2 The internal load break disconnection device does not provide isolation of the PCE. Separate safe work methods should be employed to isolate the PCE before performing any work on the PCE (refer to PCE manufacturer instructions)."
