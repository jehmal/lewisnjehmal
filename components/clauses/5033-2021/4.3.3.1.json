  "fullText": "Where the calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage exceeds 120 V, a disconnection point shall be provided to isolate each PV string at the PV modules, see Clause 4.3.5.2.1.\nEXCEPTION — A disconnection point is not required to isolate each string, where a load break disconnection device is installed adjacent to the PV modules of the PV array that is being isolated.\nNOTE 1 See Clause 4.5.3.1 for requirements on load break disconnection devices at the PCE. An additional load break disconnection device may be required where there are more than two parallel strings in accordance with Figure 4.2.\nWhere a load break disconnection device is required in addition to the disconnection point, it shall be selected in accordance with Clause 4.3.4.2 and installed in accordance with Clause 4.3.5.3.\n\nDo you need an\nadditional load break\ndisconnection device?\nAre\nthere more than\ntwo parallel\nstrings?\nIs\nthere string\nfusing on all\nparallel\nstrings?\nYes No\nAre\nthe strings\nparalleled at the\nload break disconnector\nat the inver ter?\nYes\nNo additional\nload break\ndisconnector\nrequired.\nAdditional load break\ndisconnector is\nrequired in accordance\nwith Clause 4.3.5.3.2.\nYes\nNo\nNo\nAdditional load break\ndisconnector is\nrequired in accordance\nwith Clause 4.3.5.3.3.\nNOTE The installation of wiring enclosures for the wiring system has different requirements depending on the PV isolation method, see Clause 4.4.5.2 for the installation of wiring enclosures.\nFigure 4.2 — Additional load break disconnection device requirement decision tree"
