  "fullText": "Where a cable gland is used in an outdoor environment, the cable gland shall—\n(a) be used to enter/exit an enclosure containing conductor terminations;\n(b) be installed so that each cable enters/exits through an individual hole;\n(c) be rated at least IP 56;\n(d) have a hole diameter to maintain IP rating for the cables used (e.g. the diameter of the holes in the cable gland are designed to seal the outside diameter of the cable used); and\n(e) have any spare holes sealed with the gland manufacturer's approved sealing plug.\n\nCable glands may enter/exit the bottom face of an enclosure containing conductor terminations, see Figure 4.7.\n\nWhere cable glands, enter/exit the side face of an enclosure installed in an outdoor location, the entry/exit point into the enclosure containing conductor terminations shall be higher than the lowest point of the wiring system (i.e. to create a drip loop), see Figure 4.7, and—\n(i) be within 30 degrees of the space contained by the soffit and the plane from the outer edge of the soffit; or\n(ii) be within 30 degrees from the top of the shroud and a plane from the outer edge of the mounting surface, see Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9.\n\nNOTE 1 Figure 4.8 shows disconnector but the concept applies to all enclosures containing conductor terminations.\n\nNOTE 2 See Clause 4.4.7.2.3 for conduit entry/exit points.\n\nNOTE 3 See Clause 4.4.5.2.2 for requirements of PV d.c. cables at the load break disconnection device."
