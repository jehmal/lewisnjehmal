  "fullText": "Labels/signs exposed to direct sunlight shall be UV resistant.\n\nLabels/signs shall conform to the following tests as specified in IEC 60068-2-5:2018:\n(a) Ten samples of the markings shall be exposed for 720 h to open-flame sunshine carbon-arc, in accordance with ISO 4892-4.\n(b) The test samples shall be mounted on the inside of the cylinder in the ultraviolet light apparatus perpendicular to the light source and in such a way that the samples do not touch each other.\n(c) There shall be continuous exposure to light and intermittent exposure to water spray. The cycle shall consist of 102 min without water spray and 18 min with water spray. The apparatus shall operate with an open-flame sunshine carbon-arc lamp, borosilicate glass Type 1, inner and outer optical filters, a spectral irradiance of 0,35 W/m2/nm at 340 nm and a black panel temperature of (63 ± 3) °C. The temperature of the chamber shall be (45 ± 3) °C. The relative humidity in the chamber shall be (50 ± 5) %.\n\nLegibility of markings on equipment intended for outdoor use shall not be degraded by UV radiation.\n\nEXCEPTION — This requirement does not apply to markings that are physically engraved, embossed or etched with durable markings."
