  "title": "CURRENT CARRYING CAPACITY",
  "fullText": "Each conductor shall have a current carrying capacity:\n(a) in accordance with the AS/NZS 3008.1 series; and\n(b) greater than or equal to the current carried by the conductor of the circuit they are fitted to according to Clause 4.2.2.\nNOTE 1 AS/NZS 3008.1 series applies to a.c. cables, but for the purposes of this document the current rating tables and calculations are relevant for d.c. also.\nNOTE 2 De-rating factors to consider can include cable location, installation method, manufacturer specifications, elevated ambient temperatures in ceiling spaces and direct sunlight.\nNOTE 3 In some PV module technologies ISC MOD is higher than the nominal rated value during the first weeks or months of operation. In other technologies ISC MOD increases over time. This should be taken into account when establishing cable ratings.\nA minimum operating temperature equal to the maximum expected ambient temperature +40 Â°C should be considered for cables installed near or in contact with PV modules. The operating temperature of PV modules and consequently their associated wiring can be significantly higher than the ambient temperature."
