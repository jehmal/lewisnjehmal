  "fullText": "All PV conductors in a direct functionally earthed array shall be treated as live parts with respect to protection against electric shock.\nNOTE 1 See Appendix B for examples of functional earthing configurations.\nNOTE 2 The intent of this requirement is to ensure that the functionally earthed conductor is not assumed to be at earth potential during evaluation of insulation coordination aspects such as clearance to earth etc. because its connection to earth does not conform to the requirements for protective earthing.\nIn systems with direct functional earthing, an earth fault interrupter (EFI) shall be installed such that, if an earth fault occurs, the functional earth of the array is interrupted to interrupt the fault current.\nThe EFI shall sense an earth fault, interrupt the earth fault and provide an indication of the fault when earth fault currents exceed the limits shown in Table 3.2.\nWhen an EFI operates, the affected PV system shall be shut down until the fault is corrected and an earth fault alarm initiated according to Clause 3.5.3.\n\nTable 3.2 â€” Nominal overcurrent rating of earth fault interrupter\nTotal PV array power rating (kW) | Maximum earth fault detection setting (A)\n0-25 | 1\n25-50 | 2\n50-100 | 3\n100-250 | 4\n> 250 | 5\n\nNOTE Direct functional earthed systems are under review and may be precluded in future editions of this Standard. Systems that use resistive functional earthing should be used where possible, where the resistance limits possible fault current to less than 30 mA. It is important to check PV module manufacturer's requirements for bleeding charge from cells."
