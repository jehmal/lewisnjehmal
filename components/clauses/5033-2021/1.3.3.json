  "fullText": "higher irradiance at which nameplate verification is performed for bifacial modules. Bifacial nameplate irradiance (BNPI) is that which corresponds to 1000 W/m2 on the module front, and 135 W/m2 on the module rear\nNote 1 to entry: BNPI may be applied in any method allowed by IEC TS 60904-1-2, such as single-side illumination at equivalent irradiance, or double-side illumination."
