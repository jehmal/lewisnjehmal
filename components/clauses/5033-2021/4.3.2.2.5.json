  "fullText": "PV modules, PV module mounting frames, PV array structures, and the methods used for attaching PV modules to frames and frames to buildings or to the ground shall be designed to resist the ultimate wind actions. Attachments shall be appropriate for the importance level, classification and location, calculated in accordance with AS/NZS 1170.2.\nFor applications beyond the limits of AS/NZS 1170.2, reference should be made to other publications or alternatively seek further advice, which may include wind tunnel testing or computer simulations.\nNOTE 1 Key issues to be considered include but are not limited to the following:\n(a) Fixing spacings appropriate to roof type and location on roof.\n(b) Minimum embedment depth (into timber) and the minimum sheet thickness (into steel).\n(c) Fastener specification (e.g. type or gauge).\n(d) Exclusion zones.\n(e) The maximum wind speed expected (or known) on site should be used, with due consideration to regular wind events (cyclones, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc.).\nThe PV array structure shall be secured in accordance with applicable regulations and Standards.\nNOTE 2 Applicable building codes may apply when securing the PV array structure.\nWhere a PV array is to be installed on a pre-existing building or structure, an assessment of the capability of the building to support the static and dynamic loads due to the array should be carried out.\nWind force applied to the PV array may generate a significant load for associated building structures. This load should be included in the assessment of the capability of the building to withstand the resulting forces."
