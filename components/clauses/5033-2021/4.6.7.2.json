  "title": "FUNCTIONAL EARTHING TERMINAL OF PV SYSTEM",
  "fullText": "When the PV array is earthed for functional reasons, the connection to earth shall be made at a single point, and this point shall be connected to the electrical installation earthing system.\n\nNOTE 1 Some electrical installations have sub-earthing terminals. Connection of the PV functional earth to sub-earthing terminals is acceptable, provided it has been considered for this use.\n\nIn systems without batteries, this connection point shall be between the PV array disconnection device and the PCE, and as close as possible to or located inside the PCE.\n\nIn systems containing batteries, this connection point shall be between the charge controller and the battery protection device.\n\nNOTE 2 This is to allow for interruption of any earth fault current.\n\nNOTE 3 Some PV module technologies require a functional earth on either the positive or negative main conductor of the system to bleed charge away from the PV cells. This is an operational requirement or may be required to prevent degradation of the PV cells. Manufacturer's instructions should be followed. Where possible the functional earthing to bleed charge from the PV cells should be via a resistor and not directly to earth. The resistor value should be the highest resistor value allowable, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions."
