  "title": "EARTH FAULT ALARM",
  "fullText": "Where the calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage is above 120 V or the PV array is connected to a non-separated inverter conforming to IEC 62109-2, an earth fault alarm system shall be installed.\nThe alarm system shall continue repeating its operation at least at hourly intervals until the earth fault is corrected or until the fault is acknowledged.\nThe earth fault alarm shall be at least one of the following types:\n(a) Remote communication (such as email, SMS or similar).\n(b) Local indication.\nWhere local indication is used for the earth fault alarm, it shall be either an audible or visual signal placed in an area that will be noticed.\nA set of operational instructions shall be provided that includes the actions to take when the alarm operates.\nNOTE Many inverters have earth fault detection and indication, in the form of indicator lights. This indication is generally not in an area that will be noticed. IEC 62109-2 requires that inverters have a local indication and a means of signalling an earth fault externally. The external alarm function should be used to cause an action to be initiated to correct the earth fault (i.e. by placing a light or audible signal where it will be noticed)."
