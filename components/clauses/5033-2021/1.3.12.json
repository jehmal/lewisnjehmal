  "fullText": "mechanical switching device which provides, in the open position, an isolating distance in accordance with specified requirements\nNote 1 to entry: A disconnector is capable of opening and closing a circuit when either negligible current is broken or made, or when no significant change in the voltage across the terminals of each of the poles of the disconnector occurs. It is also capable of carrying currents under normal circuit conditions and carrying currents for a specified time under abnormal conditions such as those of short circuit.\nNote 2 to entry: A load break disconnection device, such as switch disconnectors and some circuit breakers, provides a load break isolation function. In this Standard these devices are identified on warning signs and labels as \"Isolators\" for simplicity in interpretation by the public."
