  "fullText": "PV array wiring and associated components are often exposed to UV, wind, water, snow and other severe environmental conditions. Wiring and components shall be fit for purpose and installed in a way to minimize exposure to detrimental environmental effects.\nPV array equipment and associated components shall be installed in accordance with the requirements of this section, and the additional requirements as specified in the manufacturer's instructions where applicable.\nNOTE 1 Attention is drawn to the need for prevention of water accumulation in cable/PV module support systems.\nNOTE 2 All installed equipment should conform with the applicable EMC requirements as specified in AS CISPR 11 or IEC 62920.\nMeans of safe disconnection of the array shall be provided.\nAll components shall conform with the following requirements:\n(a) Be rated for d.c. use.\n(b) Have a voltage rating greater than or equal to the calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage in accordance with Clause 4.2.1.3.\n(c) Have a current rating greater than or equal to the calculated PV d.c. circuit current in accordance with Clause 4.2.2.\n(d) Be UV resistant unless installed in a location protected against the effects of UV radiation.\n(e) Have a temperature rating appropriate to their location and application.\nNOTE 3 PV arrays are installed in full sun. Ambient temperatures and temperatures inside enclosures can be very high. This is an important consideration when selecting components.\nNOTE 4 All components used in salt mist conditions should be suitable for use in these conditions."
