  "title": "OPEN CIRCUIT VOLTAGE (VOC)",
  "fullText": "This test is to ensure that the series connected strings of PV modules are correctly balanced within PV arrays. The tested Voc of each PV array should align to confirm the number of series connected PV modules for the calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage values, also confirming the installation is installed to be within the required voltage limits of the connected equipment.\n\nThis test shall be carried when all cables are in their final position with all strings connected. In large systems, open circuit voltage testing should be carried out on string sections of the array first and then on the complete array after sub-array switches are closed.\n\nBefore commencing the test:\n(a) limit access by non-authorized personnel; and\n(b) isolate the PV array from the inverter (typically) at the PCE switch disconnector.\n\nThe open circuit voltage test shall be carried out with an appropriately rated voltage tester, connected between the isolated PV string/array positive connection, to the PV string/array negative connection.\n\nThe test is to be repeated for every series connected string.\n\nTest leads should be made secure before carrying out the test.\n\nThe values of the open circuit voltage tests shall be recorded.\n\nAll strings connected in parallel shall have open circuit voltages be within 5 %, see Clause 2.1.6."
