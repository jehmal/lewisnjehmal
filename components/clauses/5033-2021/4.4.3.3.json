  "title": "TERMINATION OF CABLES",
  "fullText": "All connections shall be checked for tightness and polarity during installation.\nWhere the calculated PV d.c. circuit maximum voltage is above 35 V, double insulation or a segregation insulation barrier equivalent to double insulation, shall be maintained up to and including the point of termination.\nSegregation insulation barriers between the d.c. and a.c. circuits shall be to the appropriate level for the installation environment, and not less than the degree of protection IP4X.\nNOTE 1 This is to minimize the risks of d.c. arcs occurring between conductors and terminations.\nNOTE 2 Standard wiring practice should be maintained at terminations of cables to remove only the minimum insulation required to achieve the connection.\nNOTE 3 Manufacturers installation instructions can include requirements relating to the bend radius of the cable.\nWhere devices such as switches for circuits requiring segregation are mounted on a common mounting rail in an enclosure, this rail shall not be metallic or conductive unless the entire enclosure is metallic.\nThe ends of stranded conductors shall be secured by a suitable means, to prevent the spreading or escape of individual strands (e.g. by suitable bootlace ferrules where clamping is under a screw terminal not designed for stranded conductor).\nNOTE 4 AS/NZS 3000 has specific requirements for the termination of stranded conductors."
