  "title": "PROTECTION AGAINST WEATHER AND WATER FOR DEDICATED INDIVIDUAL ENCLOSURES CONTAINING SWITCH DISCONNECTORS",
  "fullText": "Dedicated individual enclosures containing switch disconnection devices shall be protected against the effects of weather and water. Dedicated individual enclosures containing switch disconnection devices are considered to be protected against the effects of weather and water when installed eitherâ€”\n(a) within the space contained by the soffit and a plane from the outer edge of the soffit, at an angle of 30 degrees continuing to the surface that the enclosure is mounted on, see Appendix K Figure K.1; or\n(b) within a non-combustible, and mechanically stable shroud resistant to ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure where the shroud protects the switch disconnectors and meets at least the requirements of Figures K.2 and Figure K.3.\n\nNOTE 1 Shrouds that are resistant to ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure include shrouds of metal, or material that meet requirements of tests in accordance with Clause 10.2.4 of AS/NZS 61439.1.\n\nNOTE 2 The shroud is used to prevent direct exposure to sunlight over the hottest part of the day and to minimize the chance of water pooling around the isolator seals.\n\nNOTE 3 Consideration should be given to use shrouds over devices other than switch disconnectors."
