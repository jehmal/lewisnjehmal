  "fullText": "Although it is not a requirement of this Standard to provide additional protection against the initiation of fire caused by current leakage across insulation, a Type S RCD with a rated residual current in the range 100 mA to 300 mA may be used as a main switch in a domestic electrical installation, in addition to the requirements of Clause 2.6.3.\n\nNOTE: Protection is not afforded to separated circuits typically used for extra-low voltage (ELV) lighting or against the initiation of fire from equipment operating at elevated temperatures."
