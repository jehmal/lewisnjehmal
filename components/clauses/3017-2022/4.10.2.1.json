    "fullText": "The approximate earth electrode resistance may be obtained by the use of a proprietary earth fault-loop impedance meter.\nWith the MEN connection removed, the \"ground loop without PEN\" impedance shall be measured by connecting an earth fault-loop impedance meter between the incoming active supply (for example, at the main switch) and the main earth.\nThe \"ground loop without PEN\" impedance includes the installation ground resistance (the earth electrode in parallel with any bonding to grounded exposed conductive parts) in series with the distribution system ground resistance to the PEN, the transformer impedance and the active conductor impedance.\nThe approximate value obtained by the use of a proprietary earth fault-loop impedance meter is typically in the order of 10 Ω to 50 Ω in good soil conditions with non-metallic water pipes.\nNOTE This test could be carried out in conjunction with the test in Clause 4.12.5.1.\nWARNING: AS THIS TEST PROCEDURE REMOVES THE PARALLEL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE EARTHING SYSTEM AND THE SUPPLY NEUTRAL, ENSURE THERE IS NO CURRENT FLOWING IN THE MEN CONNECTION BEFORE REMOVING IT."
