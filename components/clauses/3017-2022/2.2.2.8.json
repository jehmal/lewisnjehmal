    "fullText": "Any suitable length of insulated conductor may be used. A dedicated lead, kept on a suitable reel, is recommended. The lead's conductor should be a flexible type, e.g. appliance wire.\nFor earth continuity testing, the resistance of the lead shall be known. The value should be recorded.\nFor confirming no hazardous voltage is present on earth-referenced systems; the lead should have a suitable terminal or clip to permit easy connection to the independent earth spike (see Clause 2.2.2.9).\nNOTE Refer to Appendix A for additional information."
