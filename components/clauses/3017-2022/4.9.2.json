    "fullText": "Testing the operation of RCDs requires supply to be available either from the normal supply or by a portable independent source as outlined in Clause 2.2.2.6\nWARNING: TESTING THE OPERATION OF RCDS REQUIRES ENERGIZING THE RCD AND THE CIRCUIT(S) IT PROTECTS. ACCORDINGLY, EXTREME CARE IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THIS TEST CAN BE (AND IS) CARRIED OUT SAFELY.\nTesting RCDs does not provide a means of checking â€”\n(a) the continuity of the main earthing conductor;\n(b) any earth electrode or other means of earthing; or\n(c) any part of the associated electrical installation earthing other than the circuit under test.\nAny standing leakage current on the protected circuit(s) may add or subtract vectorially from the test current; causing either nuisance tripping or delayed operation. To reduce such effects, the protected circuits should be carrying no load when tested.\nThe wave form of a fault current to earth can affect the operation of both an RCD and test equipment, in particular, circuits utilizing a variety of semiconductor devices. The suitability of an RCD shall be confirmed in accordance with Clause 3.3(c)(ix).\nTo avoid damage to test equipment; where the source of supply is other than smooth sinusoidal, such as an inverter, the advice of the manufacturer of the RCD test instrument should be sought."
