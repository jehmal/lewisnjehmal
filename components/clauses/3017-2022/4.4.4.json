    "fullText": "The resistance of protective earthing conductors shall be —\n(a) low enough to permit the passage of current necessary to operate the overcurrent protective device; and\n(b) consistent with the length, cross-sectional area and type of conductor material.\nThe resistance of the main earthing conductor or any equipotential bonding conductor shall be not more than 0.5 Ω.\nThe resistance of the combined protective earthing and neutral (PEN) shall be low enough to permit the passage of current necessary to operate the circuit protective device.\nNOTE 1 As described in Clause 4.8 (EFLI), the maximum allowable resistance of the protective earthing conductor associated with any particular circuit depends on the type and rating of the protective device and the impedance of the live conductors that comprise the circuit in which the fault occurs.\nNOTE 2 Maximum resistance values (Re) for earthing conductors related to size of conductor and rating of Re for earthing conductors are given in AS/NZS 3000 as a function of the rating of the associated overcurrent protective device. These values may be used when testing for earth continuity."
