    "fullText": "This Standard sets out some of the common inspection and test methods required to verify that a low voltage electrical installation, or part installation, complies with safety requirements.\nThis Standard illustrates testing procedures for an electrical installation connected to a Multiple Earth Neutral (MEN) (TN-C-S) system of earthing. The equipment and methods â€”\n(a) are not exclusive and other equipment and methods may be used; provided they give equally valid results; and\n(b) may be applied to types of low voltage installations other than MEN (TN-C-S); and\n(c) may be applied to work that affects only part of an installation, e.g. alterations or repairs.\nAlthough verification of compliance refers to the completed work undertaken, it is reasonable to expect that the inspection and test methods set out in this Standard may be applied during the design, selection and installation phases of the work as a matter of sound practice. Records of the on-going inspection and testing would contribute to verification of the completed work.\nThis Standard describes alternate test methods for electrical installations that are either energized or de-energized. The user of this Standard is to determine the appropriate test methods."
