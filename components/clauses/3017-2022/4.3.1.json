    "fullText": "Before any electrical testing can be undertaken, the presence of any voltage shall be identified.\nIrrespective of the type of tests (continuity, insulation resistance) being performed, a test to confirm whether any voltage is present on the circuit(s) under test shall be performed before any further actions.\nParticular care is required where there may be multiple sources, for example:\n(a) Alternative or supplementary supplies.\n(b) Circuits with multiple switching paths.\nConfirming the absence of supply voltage on active conductors is not sufficient.\nWARNING: ALL ELECTRICAL CONDUCTORS, INCLUDING EARTHING CONDUCTORS, SHALL BE TREATED AS ENERGIZED UNTIL PROVEN DE-ENERGIZED.\nNOTE 1 Even when all normal, alternative, and supplementary supplies to an installation have been isolated; faults in the supply network, or within another installation, can result in hazardous voltages being present. Common examples include the following:\n(i) Incorrect polarity of the incoming supply, resulting in the installation's earthing system being energized and isolation devices being ineffective.\n(ii) Faulty connections in PEN conductors of other installations supplied from same source, resulting in load current of the other installation being carried by the installation's earthing system and supply neutral.\nNOTE 2 Caution is needed when disconnecting an MEN link or connections of the main earthing conductor, in case either is carrying current.\nNOTE 3 Capacitive or induced voltage could influence test results."
