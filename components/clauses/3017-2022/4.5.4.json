    "fullText": "The insulation resistance shall be not less than 1 MΩ.\nException: Acceptable insulation resistance values for items likely to adversely affect test results are as follows:\n(a) For sheathed heating elements of appliances, not less than 0.01 MΩ.\n(b) A value permitted in the Standard applicable to the electrical equipment.\n(c) For functional earth connections of RCD, not less than 0.05 MΩ, or as prescribed by the manufacturer.\nNOTE 1 For shorter cable runs, the insulation resistance should be significantly greater than 1 MΩ, e.g. for polymeric insulated cables up to 50 m a value in excess of 50 MΩ would be expected.\nNOTE 2 Insulation resistance varies with insulation materials, and decreases with increased length and/or higher temperature.\nNOTE 3 PVC insulated cables with a route length of 50 m can be expected to have insulation resistances of at least 20 MΩ at a temperature not exceeding 20 °C but only 6 MΩ at a temperature of 30 °C.\nNOTE 4 XLPE insulated cables can be expected to have insulation resistance of at least 1500 MΩ for a route length of 50 m.\nNOTE 5 The relevant regulatory authority or electricity distributor should be consulted regarding acceptable minimum insulation resistance values."
