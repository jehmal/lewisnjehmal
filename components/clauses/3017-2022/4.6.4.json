    "fullText": "The polarity and correct circuit connection testing shall show that all active, neutral and protective earthing conductors in the electrical installation are correctly connected to the corresponding terminals of electrical equipment so that â€”\n(a) there is no transposition of conductors that could result in the electrical equipment becoming unsafe when it is connected to supply, particularly where appliances are connected by socket-outlets;\n(b) switches or protective devices do not operate in the earthing or a combined protective earthing and neutral (PEN) conductor;\n(c) switches or protective devices do not operate independently in neutral conductors;\n(d) all Edison screw lampholders that are not incorporated in an appliance or provided with a shroud or skirt that prevents contact with the outer contact shall have the neutral connected to the outer contact;\n(e) all fixed socket-outlets for multiphase supplies are connected so the phase sequence is the same throughout the installation;\n(f) there are no short-circuits between the live conductors; and\n(g) there is no connection between live (active or neutral) conductors of different circuits.\nNOTE Any MEN or ESR connection is not considered as a short-circuit."
