    "fullText": "The integrity of the insulation is stressed by applying a direct current at 500 V for low voltage circuits.\nException 1: Where equipment, such as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) filters, equipment containing surge protective devices connected to earth, or electronic equipment, is likely to be damaged by the test. Such equipment may be disconnected or switched off before carrying out the insulation resistance test on the circuit; or the test voltage for the particular circuit may be reduced to 250 V d.c. The insulation resistance test is performed between â€”\n(a) each live conductor and each other live conductor of consumers mains and submains; and\n(b) all live (active and neutral) conductors and earth for consumers mains, submains and final sub-circuits; and\n(c) all live (active and neutral) conductive parts and earthed parts (earthing system) of equipment connected to the installation.\nException 2: Where connected equipment such as sheathed heating elements of appliances or an RCD with an FE connection is likely to influence the test, the equipment may be disconnected before carrying out the insulation resistance test on the circuit, and the equipment tested separately."
