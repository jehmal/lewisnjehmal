    "fullText": "Testing to prove the continuity of the earthing system (earth resistance of the main earthing conductor, protective earthing conductors, combined protective earthing and neutral (PEN) conductors and bonding conductors) shall be carried out to ensure that the earthing system has been installed in a manner that will cause circuit protective devices to operate if there is a fault between live parts, other than the neutral, and the mass of earth.\nAn effective earthing system will ensure that exposed conductive parts of electrical equipment do not reach dangerous voltages when such faults occur.\nWhere the touch potential exceeds 50 V a.c or 120 V ripple-free d.c., the circuit-protective device shall cause disconnection of supply within the required time."
