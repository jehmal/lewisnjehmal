    "fullText": "The resistance to ground of the installation earth electrode shall be tested using the \"fall of potential method\".\nFigure 4.30 shows the fall of potential method of testing the electrode, using a proprietary meter.\nNOTE IEC 61557‑5 specifies that the meter is required to have a maximum output voltage of 50 V and a maximum current of 3.5 mA.\nThe approximate value obtained by the use of a proprietary meter is typically in the order of 50 Ω to 200 Ω in good soil conditions.\nWARNING: EXTREME CARE IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THIS TEST CAN BE AND IS CARRIED OUT"
