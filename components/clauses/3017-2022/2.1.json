    "fullText": "The following test instruments are required to carry out all the tests detailed in this Standard:\n(a) Voltage indicator.\n(b) Volt meter.\n(c) Low range ohmmeter.\n(d) Insulation resistance test instrument.\n(e) Instrument for measuring fault-loop impedance.\n(f) Instrument or device for initiating the operation of a RCD.\nNOTE 1 Measuring the operation time of the RCD is not required by this Standard.\nThese instruments may be individual instruments designed for conducting just one type of test; or multi-function instruments capable of conducting a range of tests.\nWhere a test instrument assesses results as \"pass\" or \"fail\"; it is crucial that the parameters are correctly set up.\nNOTE 2 Instruments with multiple functionality are often referred to as \"installation testers\". Such instruments often have additional functions not required for testing electrical work; but useful for other testing purposes, such as diagnosing faults.\nNOTE 3 If there is no setting that exactly matches the pass/fail criterion stipulated for the particular test procedure; the nearest setting on the \"fail\" side should be used. This is to ensure that the instrument does not provide false \"pass\" results.\nRegardless of which type(s) of instruments are chosen, the user shall â€”\n(i) understand the use and capabilities of the instrument for each type of test;\n(ii) ensure that the instrument meets the requirements specified in Clause 2.2.1; and\n(iii) ensure that the instrument is correctly set up.\nFor some tests, additional equipment will be required. For example, the following:\n(A) Test leads and probes.\n(B) Trailing leads.\n(C) Means of making temporary connection to mass of earth.\n(D) A range of resistors of known value.\n(E) Portable independent sources providing a 50 Hz supply."
