    "fullText": "A visual inspection shall be performed when work on an electrical installation has been completed in order to verify that the work complies with the applicable requirements.\nThe visual inspection shall be carried out before, or in association with testing. Visual inspection should, where practicable, be completed before the relevant part of the electrical installation is placed in service.\nWhere the visual inspection of a part of the electrical installation is not practicable at the completion of the work, e.g. not accessible due to enclosure in the building structure, consideration should be given to inspecting that part during the course of the installation."
