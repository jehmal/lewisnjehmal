    "fullText": "Figure 4.1 shows a preferred sequence for testing electrical installation work.\nNOTE The order in which the various tests are carried out matters, because a fault found by a later test may have caused a misleading result in a different type of test carried out previously. For example, insulation resistance tests between live parts and earth cannot be relied on unless the integrity of the earthing system has first been proven.\nEarth resistance test of the continuity of main earthing conductorClause 4.4 Earth resistance test for other earthed and equipotential bonded partsClause 4.4Insulation resistance testing of the installationClause 4.5Consumer mains polarity and correct connection testClause 4.6 Submains polarity and correct connection testClause 4.6 Earth fault-loop impedance testClause 4.8Verification of the operation of residual current devicesClause 4.9 Final subcircuit polarity and correct connection testClauses 4.6 and 4.7Test for de-energizedClause 4.3\nNOTE The sequence of tests shown in this figure is recommended. Tests performed out of sequence may result in invalid results for subsequent tests."
