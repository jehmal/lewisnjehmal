    "fullText": "The condition of the supply neutral may be assessed by measuring the current in the consumers mains active(s) and neutral conductors, the main earthing conductor and the MEN connection.\nWith a substantial load such as an electric range or water heater applied, a clamp ammeter shall be used to measure the current flow in the active and neutral conductors separately, upstream of the MEN connection, and in the MEN connection.\nFor multiphase installations, the clamp meter shall be placed around all active conductors simultaneously, ensuring the line and load of each phase conductor is orientated the same way.\nNOTE 1 The current flowing in the active conductor(s) and the neutral conductor should be substantially the same.\nNOTE 2 If a large proportion of the active current is flowing in the main earthing conductor and MEN connection, there is the possibility of a continuity problem with the consumer mains/service neutral connections for that installation.\nNOTE 3 If the current in the main neutral conductor and MEN connection exceeds that in the active conductor(s), there is a possibility of a continuity problem with another installation further from the distribution transformer than the installation under test. This can be confirmed by checking for current in the main neutral conductor and the MEN connection with the main switch(es) off."
