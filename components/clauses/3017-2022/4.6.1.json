    "fullText": "Polarity and correct circuit connection testing shall be carried out to ensure that no shock hazard arises from the incorrect connection of active, neutral and earthing conductors.\nThis testing is to prevent â€”\n(a) the transposition of active and neutral conductors of the consumer mains, or submains supplying an outbuilding having an MEN connection, resulting in the electrical installation earthing system becoming energized; and\n(b) combinations of incorrect active, neutral and earthing conductor connections resulting in the exposed conductive parts of the electrical installation becoming energized; and\n(c) the connection of switches or protective devices in neutral conductors resulting in parts of appliances, such as heating elements and lampholders, remaining energized when the switches are in the \"OFF\" position; and\n(d) multiphase equipment, such as multiphase motors, and semiconductor-controlled equipment operating in an unpredictable manner; and\n(e) protective earthing conductors carrying current under normal conditions of operation; and\n(f) short-circuits existing between conductors.\nPhase sequence testing is necessary to ensure that multi-phase equipment operates in a predictable manner, e.g. multi-phase motors, semiconductor controlled equipment etc. (see Clause 4.7)."
