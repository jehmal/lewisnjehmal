    "fullText": "The polarity and correct circuit connection testing shall show that all active, neutral and protective earthing conductors in the electrical installation are correctly connected to the corresponding terminals of electrical equipment so that all fixed socket-outlets of the same type for multiphase supplies are connected so the phase sequence is the same throughout the installation.\nPhase sequence testing of socket outlets shall show a consistent phase polarity across all multi-phase socket-outlets of the same type of the installation on the circuit and be compatible with the operational requirements of connected consumer equipment."
