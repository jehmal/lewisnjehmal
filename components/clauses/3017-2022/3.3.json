    "fullText": "This clause provides a guide to the matters to be checked during the visual inspection.\nThe lists below are representative of items in an electrical installation that are the subject of visual inspection. They include but are not limited to the following:\n(a) General:\n(i) Basic protection (protection against direct contact with live parts), e.g. insulation and enclosure.\n(ii) Fault protection (protection against indirect contact with exposed conductive parts), e.g. by the use of automatic disconnection of supply, double insulation or isolating transformers.\n(iii) Protection against hazardous parts, e.g. enclosure, guarding or screening of flammable materials, hot surfaces and parts that may cause physical injury.\n(iv) Protection against spread of fire, e.g. penetration of fire barriers.\n(v) General condition of the electrical equipment, e.g. signs of damage that could impair safe operation, disconnection of unused electrical equipment.\n(b) Consumer mains:\n(i) Consumer mains wiring conductors shall be clearly identified to indicate their intended function.\n(ii) Installation wiring systems conditions, e.g. underground systems — enclosure, depth of burial, mechanical protection. Aerial systems — mechanical protection, cables likely to be disturbed, support systems.\n(iii) Connection of wiring.\n(iv) Protection against external influences.\n(v) Arrangement.\n(c) Switchboards:\n(i) Location, e.g. access and egress.\n(ii) Protective devices, e.g. selection and setting of adjustable protective devices for compliance with overcurrent protection, arc fault protection and discrimination requirements.\n(iii) Isolating devices, e.g. main switches.\n(iv) Connecting devices, e.g. neutral bars, earth bars and active links.\n(v) Connection and fixing of wiring and switchgear.\n(vi) Identification and labelling of electrical equipment.\n(vii) Protection against external influences.\n(viii) Construction (refer to applicable Standards).\n(ix) Correct RCDs installed or alternate protection method.\n(d) Wiring systems:\n(i) Conductor size — coordination with protective devices.\n(ii) Identification of cable cores.\n(iii) Adequate support and fixing.\n(iv) Connections and enclosures.\n(v) Particular installation conditions, e.g. underground, aerial, safety services.\n(vi) Segregation from other services and electrical installations.\n(vii) Protection against external influences, e.g. enclosure.\n(e) Electrical equipment:\n(i) Isolation and switching devices for protection against injury from mechanical movement devices and motors.\n(ii) Isolation and switching devices for protection against thermal effects, e.g. motors, room heaters, water heaters.\n(iii) Switching devices for particular electrical equipment, e.g. socket-outlets, water heaters, etc.\n(iv) Particular installation conditions, e.g. locations affected by water, explosive atmospheres, extra-low voltage, high voltage.\n(v) Conformance with applicable Standards and the additional requirements as specified in the manufacturers' instructions.\n(vi) Connection, support and fixing.\n(vii) Protection against external influences including ingress of moisture (IP rating) where required by any clause.\n(viii) Suitability for intended voltage, current and frequency.\n(f) Earthing:\n(i) MEN (TN-C-S) connection (link).\n(ii) Earth electrode.\n(iii) Earthing conductors, e.g. size, identification.\n(iv) Equipotential bonding conductors; e.g. size, identification.\n(v) Connections, joints and terminations.\n(vi) Protection against external influences.\n(vii) Connection to earthing arrangements for other systems.\n(viii) Creation of earthed situation that may require earthing of additional electrical equipment."
