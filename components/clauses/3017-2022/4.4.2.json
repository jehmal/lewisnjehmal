    "fullText": "In some situations, such as the connection of equipotential bonding conductors to water piping or swimming pools, the terminations of conductors may not be accessible due to further building activities or enclosure.\nIf this is expected to occur, testing at the termination should be carried out at the time of initial connection or other convenient time when the termination is still accessible.\nWhere this is not practicable, the inaccessible connection may be proven by testing at a more convenient point on the parts which are to be earthed or bonded by the conductor.\nNOTE 1 Where there is a possibility of a parallel connection between a protective earthing conductor and other conductive parts, e.g. a water heater, the protective earthing conductor may be disconnected from the electrical device and tested independently.\nNOTE 2 Tables 4.5 and 4.6 of this document are for miniature circuit breakers only. Where other than miniature circuit breakers are used as the protection device, the manufacturer's data shall be consulted to obtain the value of current (Ia) for calculating the resistance of the protective earthing conductor."
