    "fullText": "The purpose of this equipment is to enable testing of RCDs in cases where normal supply is not available.\nSuitable sources include â€”\n(a) a motor-generator set; or\n(b) a battery-powered inverter with a nominally \"pure sine wave\" output.\nThe output of the source shall be sufficient to supply the required test current without causing voltage to drop.\nNOTE Refer to Appendix A for additional information."
