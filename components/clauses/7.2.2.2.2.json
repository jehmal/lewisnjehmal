  "fullText": "Where the relevant Standard does not specify a WS classification, the wiring system shall be of a type that is: (a) capable of maintaining supply to the equipment when exposed to either fire or mechanical damage; or (b) capable of maintaining supply to the equipment when exposed to fire and protected against mechanical damage by: (i) installation in a suitable enclosure; or (ii) installation in a location where the system will not be exposed to mechanical damage.\n\nConductors supplying safety services shall: (A) be physically separated from all other wiring systems by at least 50 mm horizontally or by suitable barriers [see Clause 3.9.8.1, Items (d) and (e)]; and (B) be separated from all other safety services by at least 50 mm horizontally or by suitable barriers.\n\nConductors of different safety services shall not: (1) be incorporated with each other within a multi-core cable; or (2) with conductors of any other wiring system within a multi-core cable.\n\nWhere any WS cabling traverses environments that dictate different mechanical protection requirements, and it is neither viable nor practicable to change the degree of protection at the transition points, the installed cabling shall comply with the highest requirement of protection.",
