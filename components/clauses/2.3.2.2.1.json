  "fullText": "*\tDevices for isolation shall effectively isolate all active conductors from the circuit.\nA\tsemiconductor\t(solid-state)\tdevice\tshall\tnot\tbe\tused\tfor\tisolation purposes.\nA device for isolation—\n(a)\tshall be capable of withstanding an impulse voltage likely to occur at the point of installation, or shall have an appropriate contact gap;\n(b)\tshall not be able to falsely indicate that the contacts are open;\n(c)\tshall clearly and reliably indicate the isolating position of the device;\nNOTE: The symbols 'O' (OFF) and 'I' (ON) are deemed to satisfy this requirement.\n(d)\tshall be designed and installed so as to prevent unintentional closure, such as might be caused by impact, vibration or the like;\n(e)\tshall be a device that disconnects all active conductors of the relevant supply; and\nNOTE: Single-pole devices situated adjacent to one another may be used.\n(f)\tshall be readily available.\nWhere a device for isolation is not capable of interrupting normal load current, suitable measures shall be taken to prevent it operating while carrying current.\nNOTE: Such measures may include interlocking with an associated circuit- breaker or, where the device will only be operated by authorized persons, suitable warning notices.\nWhere a device for isolation is a switching device it shall be capable of being secured in the open position.\nNOTE: Isolation may be achieved by means such as switch-disconnectors (switch isolators) or, where switching is not required, by—\n(a)\tmulti-pole or single-pole disconnectors (off load isolators);\n(b)\tplugs and socket-outlets;\n(c)\tfuses;\n(d)\tlinks; or\n(e)\tspecial terminals that do not require the removal of a conductor."
