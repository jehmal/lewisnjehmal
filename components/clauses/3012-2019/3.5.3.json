    "fullText": "The insulation resistance or leakage current of Class I (earthed conductive parts) and Class II (double insulated) electrical equipment shall be tested in accordance with the method in AS/NZS 3760. The exception to the method in AS/NZS 3760 is for fixed equipment, where the insulation resistance shall be measured from the earth terminal of the equipment rather than the earth pin of a plug.\nThe insulation resistance values measured shall be not less than the minimum values given in AS/NZS 3760."
