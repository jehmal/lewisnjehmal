    "fullText": "Where false-cars are installed for the purpose of the installation of lift shaft equipment, construction wiring for electrical supply to the false-car should comply with the following requirements:\n(a)\tBe supplied from a minimum 230 V, 20 A socket-outlet on a separate final sub-circuit protected by a 30 mA residual current device that operates in all live (active and neutral) conductors. The supply should be provided for the sole purpose of providing adequate power to the climbing hoist, including task lighting and power for the use of electrical tools when working from the false-car working platform.\n(b)\tThe flexible cord or cable should beâ€”\n(i)\tsecured at the top of the lift shaft and at the point of attachment to the false-car by suitable means to prevent mechanical damage;\n(ii)\tsuspended in the lift shaft in a manner that will ensure adequate running clearance between the false-car and the lift shaft to prevent fouling or mechanical damage to the cord or cable; and\n(iii)\tof sufficient length to allow for free travel of the false-car throughout the length of the lift shaft.\nElectrical wiring providing supply to the false-car working platform shall be heavy-duty, double insulated, flexible cord or cable with a minimum conductor size of 4 mm2."
