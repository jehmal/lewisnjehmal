    "fullText": "Auxiliary socket-outlet panels shall be constructed to comply with the following general requirements:\n(a)\tThe panel shall be—\n(i)\tconstructed with materials strong enough to withstand mechanical damage from the environment or other external influences that may be expected at the location;\n(ii)\tlocated at a height of between 1.2 m to 2 m above the floor and mounted securely to a permanent structure or a temporary structure that has been specifically designed for the purpose;\n(iii)\tprovided with an isolating switch controlling the incoming supply, with the switch clearly marked to indicate its function unless the function of the switch is obvious;\n(iv)\tsupplied by a dedicated final sub-circuit protected at the switchboard where the final sub-circuit originates by an RCD, with a maximum rated residual current of 30 mA, that operates in all live (active and neutral conductors) in accordance with Clause 2.4.6.1, and a circuit-breaker in accordance with Clause 2.4.5.2;\n(v)\tprovided with means to prevent mechanical damage to outgoing cables and relieve strain on plug and socket-outlet connections of flexible cords; and\nNOTE: A typical means of achieving this is by providing a support (e.g. tie bar, hanger, cross arm or stand) covered with a non-conductive material to which the cables can be anchored.\n(vi)\tlabelled in accordance with Clause 2.1.3 to indicate the source of supply.\n(b)\tThe panel shall have a degree of protection appropriate for the environment in which it is installed subject to a minimum degree of protection IP23.\n(c)\tSocket-outlets mounted on the panel shall—\n(i)\tcomply with AS/NZS 3112, AS/NZS 3123 or IEC 60309-2;\n(ii)\tbe protected against damage by extended sides or covers; and\n(iii)\tbe rated at not less than 10 A and be individually controlled by a switch operating in all live (active and neutral) conductors.\n(d)\tThe cable from the switchboard to the panel shall be construction wiring and be—\n(i)\ta minimum cross-sectional area of 4 mm2 for active and neutral conductors and corresponding 2.5 mm2 earth conductors;\n(ii)\twhen used in multi-level buildings, confined to the level of the switchboard from which they originate, except in lift shafts, service shafts, mezzanine levels, stairwells, formwork or external staging;\n(iii)\tin accordance with the AS/NZS 5000 series;\n(iv)\tidentified in accordance with Clause 2.5.4; and\n(v)\tprotected, where required, from mechanical damage in accordance with Clause 2.5.3.\n(e)\tIn New Zealand only, the RCD type shall be a type that provides protection against electric shock that complies with the requirements of a Type A RCD in accordance with IEC 61008-1 or IEC 61009-1."
