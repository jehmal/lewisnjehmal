    "fullText": "Overhead wiring should be positioned to avoid crossing roadways or access ways where cranes, high loads or heavy machinery may travel.\nWhere it is not possible to avoid access ways, an effective means shall be provided to minimize the risk of vehicular contact with the overhead wiring system.\nThis condition may be satisfied by the placement of flagged catenary wires or cables of suitable material across the access wayâ€”\n(a)\t6 m on either side of the overhead wiring; and\n(b)\t0.6 m below the lowest point of the overhead electrical cables or lower."
