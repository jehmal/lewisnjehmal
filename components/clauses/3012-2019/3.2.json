    "title": "FREQUENCY OF VERIFICATION",
    "fullText": "The frequency of verification is determined by examination of the actual environment where the equipment is being used rather than the type of equipment in use. The frequency is based on the level of hazard/risk and the degree of misuse to which the equipment is exposed. This consideration should be based on the specific conditions immediately effecting the particular item of equipment and not on general site conditions.\nNOTE: Regulatory authorities, other Standards, workplace safety requirements or manufacturer's instructions may specify shorter intervals appropriate to particular industries or specific types of equipment.\nConstruction wiring and electrical equipment shall be verified as follows:\n(a)\tNew equipment  Prior to the initial introduction into service.\n(b)\tRepaired or serviced equipment  Prior to the return to service after a repair or servicing that could have affected the electrical safety.\n(c)\tHire equipment  Inspection prior to each hire and testing at not greater than monthly intervals. If hire equipment remains on site then Table 6 applies.\n(d)\tAll equipment  Intervals not exceeding those specified in Table 6."
