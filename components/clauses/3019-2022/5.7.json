    "fullText": "Tests shall be performed on each RCD to assess whether the RCD operates as required to disconnect the circuit(s) it protects. The correct operation of the RCDs shall be assessed by the use of test equipment to −\n(a) initiate operation of the RCD, and\n(b) confirm that the RCD operates in the active conductor(s) of the circuit(s) to which it is connected, and in the neutral conductor where required.\nEXCEPTION: Where this function has been tested under Clause 4.2.2.5, the test need not be repeated under this clause.\nIn addition, correct operation of RCDs should be further assessed by the use of test equipment to —\n(i) test, by applying a gradually rising a.c. residual current, whether the RCD operates before the rated residual current is exceeded, and\n(ii) test, by applying rated a.c. residual current, whether the RCD operates within the required time limit.\nNOTE Type A, Type B and Type F RCDs have additional functionality, including sensitivity to residual d.c. currents as well as residual a.c. currents. It is not a requirement of this Standard to test the performance of RCDs using residual current waveforms other than a.c. When testing with d.c. currents, the operating residual current may exceed the rated residual current label on the RCD. The RCD manufacturer should be consulted for more information."
