    "fullText": "Periodic assessment shall be performed to confirm whether the installation is electrically safe by â€”\n(a) confirming that the installation is not damaged or has not deteriorated so as to impair electrical safety; and\n(b) identifying installation defects and departures from the requirements of this document that may give rise to danger.\nThese requirements are intended to ensure the following:\n(i) The protection of persons and livestock against electric shock and burns (see Clause 2.6); and\n(ii) The protection against damage to property by fire and heat arising from an installation defect (see Clause 2.6).\nNOTE Existing installations may have been designed and installed to conform to legislative requirements applicable at the time of their design and installation. These installations may have been subsequently repaired using methods that were acceptable when the installation was originally installed. This does not necessarily mean that they are unsafe provided that the installation and repair methods satisfy the fundamental safety principles of AS/NZS 3000, Part 1."
