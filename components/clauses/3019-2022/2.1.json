    "fullText": "Electrical inspection and testing inherently involves a degree of hazard. A competent person performing the inspection and tests should ensure that safe practices are used.\nThis document prescribes some tests methods which require supply to be disconnected.\nTests where the supply is not connected minimize the risk of electric shock; however some tests require that the supply is connected and therefore additional precautions are required. AS/NZS 3017 and AS/NZS 4836 provide additional guidance."
