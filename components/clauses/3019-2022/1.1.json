    "fullText": "This document sets out the requirements for periodic assessment of existing electrical installations which are connected to a low voltage a.c. supply system (exceeding 50 V a.c. but not exceeding 1 000 V a.c.).\nInspection and/or testing is intended, as far as reasonably practicable, to determine whether the installation and all its constituent equipment is in a safe condition for continued use.\nThe assessment criteria in Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 are intended as benchmarks against which the installation is to be assessed.\nThis document does not require existing installations to be upgraded to meet the benchmarks. However, the document includes requirements for reporting any deficiencies identified.\nNOTE Inspection and testing to this document does not necessarily provide evidence that the installation complied with the relevant requirements at the time of its construction."
