    "title": "Frequency of periodic assessment",
    "fullText": "The frequency of periodic assessment of an installation shall be based on the type of installation and equipment, its use and operation, the frequency and level of maintenance and the external influences on which it is subjected.\nNOTE 1 The maximum intervals between periodic assessments may be set by legislation.\nNOTE 2 The interval may be, for instance, some years (e.g. 4 years), with the exception of the following cases where a higher risk exists and shorter periods are required:\n(a) Working places or locations where risks of electric shock, fire or explosion exist due to degradation.\n(b) Working places or locations where both high and low voltage installations exist.\n(c) Communal facilities.\n(d) Safety installations (e.g. emergency luminaires).\nNOTE 3 For domestic dwellings, longer periods (e.g. 10 years) may be appropriate. When occupancy of a domestic dwelling has changed, an assessment of the electrical installation is recommended.\nThe periodic assessment report should include advice on the next date for a further assessment.\nIn the case of an installation under an effective management system for preventive maintenance in normal use, periodic assessment may be replaced with an adequate regime of continuous monitoring and maintenance of the installation and all its constituent equipment by competent persons. Records shall be kept."
