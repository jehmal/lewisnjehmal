    "fullText": "For earthing systems, it shall be checked that â€”\n(a) the exposed parts of the earth electrode show no evidence of corrosion, damage or poor connection of the main earthing conductor;\n(b) the metallic water piping used as an earth electrode has not been replaced with nonconductive piping; and\nNOTE In installations constructed before 1976, metallic water pipe may have been used as the earth electrode. Recent work practice in the water supply industry has been to replace metallic pipes with non-conductive pipes. A dedicated earth electrode should be installed in such installations.\n(c) the exposed earth conductors show no excessive evidence of insulation or sheath deterioration and have appropriate mechanical protection for the environment in which they are installed."
