  "fullText": "Lamps, luminaires and their associated ancillary gear shall be installed so as not to cause undue temperature rise, ignition or deterioration of the materials—\n(a)\ton which they are mounted; or\n(b)\tthat they illuminate.\nLuminaires shall—\n(i)\tbe suitable for the highest temperatures to which they are likely to be subjected by external influences; and\n(ii)\tbe installed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, taking account of the highest rating of lamp to be used.\nNOTES:\n1\tSome building materials can be affected by pyrolysis—the decomposition of organic material as a result of long-term exposure to elevated temperatures. Where exposed to high temperatures for a significant period of time, such materials can self-ignite.\n2\tAttention is drawn to the high temperatures that can be generated in luminaires. Cables with suitable insulation temperature ratings should be selected."
