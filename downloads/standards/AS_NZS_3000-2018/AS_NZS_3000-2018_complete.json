The Standard may also be applied in conjunction with any additional requirements, exemptions, or restrictions in such legislation.\nThe principal application of this Standard is to electrical installations in all types of premises and land used by electricity consumers. However, the Standard may also be referenced or applied through legislative or other requirements relating to the effect of electrical installations in matters such as the following:\n• (a) Safety of workplaces.\n  o NOTE: For example, any relevant work health and safety legislation and associated codes.\n• (b) Safe design and construction of buildings.\n  o NOTE: For example, national building codes [such as the National Construction Code (NCC), New Zealand Building Code (NZBC)] and the associated referenced Standards. See Appendix E for information on NCC and NZBC.\n• (c) Electricity generation, transmission, and distribution systems.\n• (d) Safe connection to electricity distribution systems.\n  o NOTE: For example, service rules and conditions provided by local electricity distributors.\n• (e) Qualifications of electricity workers.\nPart 1 (Section 1) of this Standard provides a mechanism for acceptance of design and installation practices that may not be addressed by those given in Part 2 (Sections 2 to 8) of this Standard. This mechanism is only intended to apply where departures from the methods in Part 2 are significant.\n• NOTE: A degree of flexibility exists within Part 2."

For these typical fittings, the installation method shall be to provide barriers [see method in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(ii)] or clearances [see method in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(iii)] during installation, so as to prevent  contact  with  materials  that  may  impede  airflow (e.g. thermal insulation) or that may be affected by the high temperature (e.g. combustible building elements and insulation).\n(iii)\tWhere building insulation is already fitted and recessed luminaires are retrofitted, added or altered, precautions shall be taken during the installation of the luminaire so as not to compromise the safety of the installation.\nNOTES:\n1\tIn New Zealand, under the New Zealand Building Code, building insulation is required.\n2\tInstructions for insulation installers in relation to clearances from recessed luminaires and other types of electrical equipment that may be adversely affected by lack of cooling air circulation are included in AS 3999 in Australia and in New Zealand NZS 4246.\n(iv)\tThe presence of bulk thermal insulation, particularly over the rear of a ceiling-mounted recessed luminaire, can readily impair cooling air circulation.\nUnless the recessed luminaire manufacturer specifies otherwise [see method in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(i)] or the barrier is classified to   permit   insulation   coverage   [see   method   in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(ii)], the space above the luminaire shall remain clear. This space is shown as dimension HCB in Figure 4.9.\n(v)\tWhere  clearances  are  to  be  applied  [see  method  in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(iii)] and bulk thermal insulation is not fixed in position, one of the following means shall be provided and secured in position to maintain the clearances:\n(A)\tA barrier complying with AS/NZS 5110.\n(B)\tA guard complying with AS 3999.\n(C)\tA barrier or guard constructed of fire-resistant materials.\n(vi)\tUnless the auxiliary equipment instructions permit otherwise, any auxiliary equipment operating at a high temperature shall be installed above any insulation as illustrated in Figure 4.9.\n(vii)\tIf the recessed luminaire is supplied with a detachable barrier, the complete luminaire, including its barrier, shall be installed.\n(viii)\tFor  recessed  luminaires  with  lamps  of  wattage  higher  than 100 W, only the methods in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(i) or 4.5.2.3.1(b)(iii), shall be used.\n(ix)\tCombustible materials shall be prevented from being in close proximity or contacting hot surfaces of the recessed luminaires. This includes structural timber which may be affected by pyrolysis which over a long exposure can result in increased susceptibility to ignition.\nWhere extraneous material, such as leaves, vermin debris or combustible materials stored in a roof space, are present in proximity to the recessed luminaire, the precautions shall include the use of a suitably designed and certified recessed luminaire [see method in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(i)] or a barrier [see method in Clause 4.5.2.3.1(b)(ii)].\n(x)\tBulk thermal insulation may also be retrofitted, added or altered, in which case precautions shall be applied by the insulation installer, where recessed luminaires are present, or the luminaire installer, where insulation is present.\n(b)\tThe following precautions should be considered for the installation of recessed luminaires:\n(i)\tThe heat generated from lamps should be dissipated in order to prevent overtemperature damage to the luminaire or to adjacent materials. Cooling air circulation through or around the equipment is a requirement for the typical range of recessed luminaires.\nAS/NZS 60598.1, AS/NZS 60598.2 and AS/NZS 5110 detail the test method and the maximum surface temperatures permitted for recessed luminaires or barriers. Those standards permit a maximum temperature of adjacent materials to be no more than 90°C.\n(ii)\tUnder National Construction Code requirements, bulk thermal insulation is prevalent in modern building construction within roofs, ceilings, walls and floors depending on the type of building and its climate zone.\nAS 3999 (in Australia) and NZS 4246 (in New Zealand) include instructions for insulation installers in relation to clearances from recessed luminaires and other types of electrical equipment that may be adversely affected by lack of cooling air circulation."

      "fullText": "The protective earthing arrangements required by this standard apply to electrical installations connected to the multiple earthed neutral (MEN) distribution system, the standard distribution system used in Australia and New Zealand. Under the MEN system, the neutral conductor (PEN) of the distribution system is earthed at the source of supply at regular intervals throughout the system and at each electrical installation connected to the system. Within the electrical installation, the earthing system is separated from the neutral conductor and is arranged for the connection of the exposed conductive parts of equipment.\nNotes:\n1.\tThe MEN system as installed in Australia and New Zealand differs from the IEC system. Both systems are identical in principle but vary in detail. For further details refer to AS/NZS 61439 and AS/NZS 3007.\n2.\tThe MEN system and its various parts are illustrated in Figures 5.1 and 5.2. Figure 5.1 shows a general arrangement and Figure 5.2 an alternative arrangement in an owner or user-operated supply substation installation. The IEC 60364 series describes the MEN system as a TN-C-S system with the letters signifying:\n•\tT: The distribution system is directly connected to earth at the neutral point of the supply transformer.\n•\tN: The exposed conductive parts are connected to the earthed point of the distribution system at the MEN connection.\n•\tC: The neutral and protective conductor functions are combined in a single conductor (the neutral conductor of the distribution system).\n•\tS: The protective conductor function is separated from the neutral—separate conductors within the installation.",

(b) Supplying one or more socket-outlets. (c) Where socket-outlets are not protected by a residual current device with a residual current rating of 30 mA or less.\nNotes:\n1.\tThe tests described in Clause 8.3.9.2 are carried out to verify that the protective device will operate to disconnect an earth fault current within the time and touch voltage requirements of Clauses 5.7 and 1.5.5.3.\n2.\tFurther information on the earth fault-loop impedance is contained in Appendix B, Paragraph 84, and Clause 5.7.\n3.\tEFLI testing is not required for RCD-protected socket-outlets, as the maximum operating time of RCDs providing additional protection is less than the 0.4 s specified by Clause 5.7.2, Item (a), and Clause 1.5.5.3, Item (d).\n4.\tEFLI testing is not required for socket-outlets on separated supplies because, for these circuits, fault protection is not by automatic disconnection.\n5.\tEFLI testing is not specifically required for circuits supplying equipment other than socket-outlets because of the risk of electric shock when performing the test on live electrical equipment. For a circuit supplying other than socket-outlets, the longer permitted operating time combined with verification of earth continuity in accordance with Clause 8.3.5.2, is considered to adequately verify compliance with Clause 5.7.\n6.\tWhile EFLI testing is not required for other circuits, the maximum trip time requirement still has to be complied with. In most cases, if voltage drop requirements are complied with, the EFLI will be acceptable."
